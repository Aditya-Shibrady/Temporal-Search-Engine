The process starts off slowly. Once patients contract Ebola, the ebola virus begins to mow down their immunesystem, the same ones affected by the AIDS virus. However, Ebola is far more aggressive than AIDS and begins tearing through several types of immune cells far more quickly. The virus produces several proteins, one of which blocks immune cells from signaling antibodies to attack. Once the patientï¿½s first line of defense againstpathogens is dismantled, the virus can begin replicating.The first symptoms of Ebola are a sudden increase in body temperature, accompanied by strong headaches, joint and muscle pain. Decreased appetite and sore throat are also early indicators of the disease.
