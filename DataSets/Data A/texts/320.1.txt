The goal of these malaria prevention guidelines is to prevent malaria caused by all species, not only P. falciparum. These guidelines apply to both short-term and long-term travelers. Malaria prevention consists of a combination of mosquito avoidance measures and chemoprophylaxis. Although efficacious, the recommended interventions are not 100% effective.
