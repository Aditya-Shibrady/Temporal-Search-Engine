The virus can be transmitted via the animalï¿½s blood and body fluids. Once people become infected with Ebola,they can transmit it to others if people come in contact with their sweat, urine, breastmilk. These bodily fluids can all carry Ebola virus. People can get Ebola when they come in contact with these fluids via the eyes, nose, mouth, or broken skin. Healthcare workers are especially at risk for experiencing Ebola because they often deal with blood and bodily fluids. Ebola can also be spread through sticks from infected objects, such as needles, and interactions with infected animals. To date, Ebola is only known to be transmitted frominfected mammals and humans. Insects like mosquitoes are not linked with carrying Ebola.
