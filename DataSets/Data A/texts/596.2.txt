To determine whether they serve as reservoirs for V. cholerae O1, we collected aquatic animals typically eaten by humans,including shrimp, fish, crab, crayfish, and aquatic plants (n = 144) weekly during February 5�22, 2013. The samples werecollected from 14 environmental sites. Each sample was placed into a sterile plastic seam�locking bag and transported tothe laboratory. One gram of the sample was mixed with 100 mL of saline and then homogenized in a sterile blender; 1.5 ml of the resultant mixture was enriched in 2� APW and processed as described.
