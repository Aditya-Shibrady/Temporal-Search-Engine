The natural reservoir for Ebola has yet to be confirmed; however, bats are considered to be the most likely candidate species.[34] Three types of fruit bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti and Myonycteris torquata) were found to possibly carry the virus without getting sick.[53] As of 2013, whether other animals are involved in its spread is not known.[52] Plants, arthropods and birds have also been considered possible viral reservoirs.
