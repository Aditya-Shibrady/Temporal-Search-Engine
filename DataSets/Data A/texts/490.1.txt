The fatality rate varies from outbreak to outbreak due to the strain of the virus involved, the level of preparedness and the availability and quality of medical care. The fatality rate of the current outbreak stands at around 52%, though this will of course change.Initially the Zaire strain of Ebola was thought to be behind the current outbreak, with the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) noting a 98% match between the West African and Zaire strains. The Zaire strain of Ebola is the most deadly: it attacks all organs in the body, including the skin, and has the highest fatality rate recorded, at an average of 79%.However, a team of experts studying the West African strain reported in the New England Journal of Medicine recently that the Guinea outbreak is a new strain of the virus: though closely related to Zaire ebolavirus. Based on further research, the WHO Ebola Response Team estimates that the fatality rate of the current outbreak is between 60% and 70%.  -
