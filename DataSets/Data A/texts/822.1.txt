If it were up to the Dallas County director of homeland security, the four people quarantined shouldn't be stuck in the apartment at all. Judge Clay Jenkins, also director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said officials are working on that relocation after Duncan's partner told CNN of being forced to live with distressing living conditions. Jenkins acknowledged "some hygiene issues" in the apartment. "I would like to see those people moved to better living conditions," Jenkins told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday afternoon. "We are working on that. I would like to move them five minutes ago."
