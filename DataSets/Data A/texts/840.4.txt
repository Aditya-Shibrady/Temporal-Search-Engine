Prevention of typhus is based on avoiding the unsanitary conditions in which it spreads. It is always wise to steer clear of animals such as rats and mice that may carry disease. Travelers to areas where typhus is common should be especially cautious. To prevent the spread of typhus, body lice must be destroyed by removing them from people with the disease and by boiling or steaming their clothes.
