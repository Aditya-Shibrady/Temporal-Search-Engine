The 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria is fast unfolding as the worst known outbreak of the disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), since the outbreak was identified in March this year there have been 1350 fatalities to date, compared with 1590 fatalities from all Ebola outbreaks in the previous four decades. Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever) is one of the worldï¿½s most virulent diseases with a fatality rate of up to 90%. The WHO has recently declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa an international public-health emergency, endorsed the use of experimental drugs for Ebola patients and launched a $100 million response plan as part of an intensified campaign to combat the outbreak. - See more at: http://lsconnect.thomsonreuters.com/west-african-ebola-outbreak-rapidly-developing-global-crisis/#sthash.2tYxcu1q.dpuf
