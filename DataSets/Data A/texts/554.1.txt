Ebola cells seem to concentrate in the liver. But what we observe about Ebola is primarily because of its effects on the cells lining our blood vessels. And it does a number of things. It replicates, and disables the immune system. The second thing it does to the cell is that the cell itself becomes less functional, around the blood vessels. So the cells surrounding the blood vessels start to leak. Then it kills those blood vessels. Eventually the virus replicates enough inside the cell.
