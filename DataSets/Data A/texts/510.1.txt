Pathology associated with all malarial species is related to the rupture of infected erythrocytes and the release of parasite material and metabolites, hemozoin (ie, malaria pigment) and cellular debris. In addition to the paroxysms discussed above, the deposition of hemozoin has long been known as a characteristic feature of malaria. There is an increased activity of the reticuloendothelial system, particularly in the liver and spleen and thus their enlargement, as evidenced by macrophages with ingested infected and normal erythrocytes and hemozoin. Except for P. falciparum, the pathology associated with malaria tends to be benign. Several severe complications can be associated with falciparum malaria with cerebral malaria being the most notable and a frequent cause of death.
