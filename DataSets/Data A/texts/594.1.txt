To supplement the WHO cholera reports, we developed a framework based on literature searches and alternative disease monitoring systems, including the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), an online forum for infectious disease specialists, microbiologists and public health officials established in 1994 and administered by the International Society for Infectious Diseases since 1999.16 Although it is apassive reporting system, it complements the WHO reports by providing detailed data from media reports describing outbreaks. In an analysis of ProMED data, the number of cholera cases reported was found tobe about five times higher than the number reported by the WHO.8,17 We used population-based choleraincidence data from a multi-country study that included Asian and African countries.18ï¿½20 In additionto these sources, we reviewed data from the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON)database, published articles listed in PubMed, and online government reports
