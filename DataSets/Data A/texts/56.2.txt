Over the summer, Dr.Brantly contracted and recovered from  Ebola after successful treatment back in America, and received the experimental drug ZMapp at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The deadly disease has killed an estimated 6,000 people in four West African countries this year alone. TIME's feature on medical "Persons of the Year" also focuses on others who fought Ebola, including SIM missionary Nancy Writebol, who also contacted the virus in Liberia but survived following treatment in America.
