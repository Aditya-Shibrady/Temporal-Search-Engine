Hepatitis is a general term meaning inflammation of the liver and can be caused by a variety of different viruses such as hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. Since the development of jaundice is a characteristic feature of liver disease, a correct diagnosis can only be made by testing patientsï¿½ sera for the presence of specific anti-viral antigens or antibodies.Low endemicity areas include North America, Western and Northern Europe, Australia, and parts of South America. The carrier rate here is less than 2%, and less than 20% of the population is infected with HBV.
