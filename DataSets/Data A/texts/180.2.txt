These symptoms generally develop within a few days of infection, although they can sometimes occur after only a few hours. Without treatment, the combination of diarrhoea and vomiting can cause a person to quickly become dehydrated and go into shock (where there is a sudden massive drop in blood pressure). In the most severe cases, the condition can be fatal.
