Most people who are exposed don�t become ill and never know they are infected. However, because they shed the cholera bacteria in their stool for seven to 14 days, they can still infect others. Most people who become sick with cholera experience only mild or moderate diarrhoea that�s hard to distinguish from diarrhoea caused by other problems.
