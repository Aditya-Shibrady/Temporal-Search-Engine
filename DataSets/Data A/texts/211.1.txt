The study by Greenberg et al. shows that a single dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine containing the usual 15 �g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen is immunogenic in a high proportion of healthy young and middle-aged adults.2�These findings are welcome and reassuring, as there is little evidence of cross-reactive antibody against the novel 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in the general population, and the need for two doses had been predicted.
