Before they arrived at Emory, Brantly and Writebol had begun in Africa to receive ZMapp, an experimental serum designed from the antibodies of people who had survived Ebola, and that course of treatment continued in the United States. Emory staff also worked to replace the fluids that Brantly and Writebol were losing because of Ebolaï¿½s symptoms (which include vomiting and diarrhea), and administered a cocktail of antibiotics. The treatment worked. Both Brantly and Writebol were released within three weeks of arriving at Emory.
