If the Ebola virus is able to replicate a lot, what happens is that the patient isn�t able to mount an immune response. Then the leakiness of the blood vessels and also the destruction of the blood vessels � which leads to some of the bleedingthat is commonly associated with Ebola � takes over and the person can�t function. Their liver stops working. Often their kidneys stop working. And then they can�t put up a defense any more, and the virus just keeps on replicating.
