Malaria is a serious infection. It is common in tropical countries such as parts of Africa, Asia and South America. Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite called Plasmodium that lives in mosquitoes. A parasite is a living thing that lives in, or on, another living organism. The plasmodium parasite is passed to humans from a mosquito bite. There are four types of plasmodium that cause malaria. These are called Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae. Most cases of malaria brought into the UK are due to Plasmodium falciparum. This type of malaria is also the most likely to result in severe illness and/or death.Most infections occur in travellers returning to the UK (rather than visitors coming to the UK). The risk of getting malaria is greatest if you do not take antimalarial medication or do not take it properly. People who take last-minute holidays and those visiting friends or relatives abroad have been shown to be the least likely to take antimalarial medication.
