In October of 2010, a nationwide Cholera epidemic hit Haiti. The cumulative number of reported cholera cases to date is estimated at 684,085 of which 380,846 persons have been hospitalized, and 8,361 persons have died nationwide. A Cholera Clinic has been established at the hospital to treat those affected by the deadly disease. The need continues as Cholera is expected to plague the country for years before it is once again eradicated. Treatment and Cholera prevention education continue to be a high priority.
