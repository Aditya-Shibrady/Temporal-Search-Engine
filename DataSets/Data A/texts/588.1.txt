Typhus fever is endemic in the foothills of central LAC. In 1997, cases occurred in Alhambra (2),Bellflower (1), Foothill (2), Glendale (1), Northeast (5), and San Fernando (1) Health Districts.Ninety-two percent of reported cases were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 daysThe nonspecific clinical presentation and the lack of a definitive test during the acute phase of theillness make the early diagnosis of murine typhus difficult. Thus, diagnosis of murine typhusdepends on the clinical acumen of the treating physician, and is often confirmed after the patienthas recovered. Accurate reporting of typhus or suspect typhus cases is important to identifyendemic areas in LAC which can be monitored for the presence of disease in the animalpopulations and to institute control measures. Treatment with antibiotics hastens recovery andlessens the chance of complications.
