"How is malaria transmitted?The plasmodium parasite is usually transmitted by a particular species of mosquito, which is the anopheles mosquito. If a female anopheles mosquito bites a person who is infected with malaria, the mosquito can then carry the plasmodium parasite and spread it to others when it bites and feeds from other people's blood.When the plasmodium parasite enters your blood, it travels to your liver and then re-enters the bloodstream where it can invade your red blood cells. Eventually, these infected red blood cells burst which leads to them releasing even more of the tiny parasites into your blood. These infected red blood cells tend to burst every 48-72 hours. Each time they burst, you will usually experience an episode of chills, fever and sweating.Dr. Sarah JarvisQRabies in the UK � what it means for your travel healthRead more blog posts �What are the symptoms of malaria?There are two general types of malaria: benign and malignant. Benign malaria is milder and relatively easy to treat. Malignant malaria can be very severe and can sometimes be fatal.Symptoms of malaria usually occur between one to four weeks after the initial mosquito bite. However, in some cases, depending on the type of plasmodium you are infected with, it can take up to a year before any symptoms start to show. This means that you should suspect malaria in anyone with a feverish illness who has travelled to a malaria area within the past year, especially in the previous three months"
