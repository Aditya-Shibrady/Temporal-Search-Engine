In the absence of regulatory oversight of most commercial Ebola tests, WHO is also assessing the quality of these tests. To date, no rapid tests, either on the market or under development, have undergone full regulatory assessment, underscoring the need for an independent review of these products before they are used in the field. Some tests are marketed for research use only, and not for use with patients.
