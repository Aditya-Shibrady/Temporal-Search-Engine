Recall that Dr. Kent Brantly, 33, who works as a medical doctor for international aid organization Samaritanï¿½s Purse, contracted the Ebola disease, alongside nurse assistant Nancy Writebol of the U.S. mission group SIM. They are the very first cases with the disease being treated in the U.S. soil.
