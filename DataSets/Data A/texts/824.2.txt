The Ebola virus can be transmitted to other people only through bodily fluids when an infected individual begins to show symptoms. At the onset of illness, the amount of virus in the body is generally low, so the risk of infection is also considered small. As the disease progresses, the amount of virus in the body multiplies and so does the risk of contagion. Dr. Spencer�s fianc�e, Morgan Dixon, has been quarantined at Bellevue Hospital Center. Officials said she would be allowed to return to the apartment she shared with Dr. Spencer, which has been cleaned, and carry out the rest of her quarantine there.
