In the study by Clark et al., one or two doses of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine containing 7.5 �g of HA (50% of the standard dose), administered on various schedules, elicited robust antibody titers.3�Although two doses (for a total of 15 �g of HA) yielded higher antibody levels than one dose, the seroprotective titer was attained in at least 80% of subjects in every group.�
