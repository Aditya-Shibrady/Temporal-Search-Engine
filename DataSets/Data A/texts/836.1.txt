Severe malaria occurs when infections are complicated by serious organ failures or abnormalities in the patient's blood or metabolism. The manifestations of severe malaria includeCerebral malaria, with abnormal behavior, impairment of consciousness, seizures, coma, or other neurologic abnormalitiesSevere anemia due to hemolysis (destruction of the red blood cells)Hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine) due to hemolysisAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an inflammatory reaction in the lungs that inhibits oxygen exchange, which may occur even after the parasite counts have decreased in response to treatmentAbnormalities in blood coagulationLow blood pressure caused by cardiovascular collapseAcute kidney failureHyperparasitemia, where more than 5% of the red blood cells are infected by malaria parasitesMetabolic acidosis (excessive acidity in the blood and tissue fluids), often in association with hypoglycemiaHypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Hypoglycemia may also occur in pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria, or after treatment with quinine.
