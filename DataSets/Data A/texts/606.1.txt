Endemic malaria, population movements, and foreign travel all contribute to the malaria diagnostic problems faced by the laboratory that may not have appropriate microscopy expertise available. Changing patterns of accepted morphological appearances of malaria species, possibly due to drug pressure, strain variation, or approaches to blood collection, have created diagnostic problems that cannot easily be resolved merely by reference to an atlas of parasitology. Fortunately, new technology provides additional diagnostic options, which can be reviewed and compared to more traditional methods. Concurrently the World Health Organization (WHO) has begun a dialogue with scientists, clinicians, and manufacturersof malaria diagnostic test devices regarding the realistic possibilities for developing accurate, sensitive, and cost-effective rapid diagnostic tests for malaria. Stipulations for these rapid tests include the capability to detect100 parasites/?l from all Plasmodium spp. and the ability to perform semi quantitative measurements for monitoring drug treatment results. Also, these new technologies must be compared against accepted �gold standard� method.
