It largely has to do with two factors. The first is the person's health in general -- his or her immune system and ability to bounce back from a viral infection. The second is the type of exposure he or she got. Recovery may be more likely if it wasn't a severe exposure -- meaning, perhaps they were exposed to someone who was only early on in the illness, and the amount of virus in the bodily fluids was not yet that high, Bhadelia said. In addition, what is known about Ebola is that it requires a known marker that aids in bringing the virus from the surface of the cells into the cells.
