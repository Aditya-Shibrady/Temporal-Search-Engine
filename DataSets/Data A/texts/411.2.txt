Many Ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade prior to 2014,[201] but as of November 2014, none had yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in humans.[202][203][204] Several promising vaccine candidates have been shown to protect nonhuman primates (usually macaques) against lethal infection.[25][159][205] These include replication-deficient adenovirus vectors, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis (VSV) and human parainfluenza (HPIV-3) vectors, and virus-like particle preparations. Conventional trials to study efficacy by exposure of humans to the pathogen after immunization are obviously not feasible in this case. For such situations, the FDA has established the �animal rule� allowing licensure to be approved on the basis of animal model studies that replicate human disease, combined with evidence of safety and a potentially potent immune response (antibodies in the blood) from humans given the vaccine. Phase I clinical trials involve the administration of the vaccine to healthy human subjects to evaluate the immune response, identify any side effects and determine the appropriate dosage.
