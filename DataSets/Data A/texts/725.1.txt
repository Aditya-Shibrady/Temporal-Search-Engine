Epidemic louse borne typhus has historically caused massive mortality in the wake of war, famine, and great migrations.1 In the four years from 1918 in Eastern Europe and Russia there were up to 30 million cases, and three million deaths. In the recent past in Burundi typhus has infected prison inmates before spreading to the wider community.2 It remains a risk among refugee populations in all parts of the world, despite its omission from a recent review of health care in refugee camps. Tick borne typhus is a significant risk to human health, especially in the Eastern United States, Brazil, the Mediterranean basin, the African veld, India, and Australia. Endemic flea borne typhus occurs sporadically wherever rats and man live closely together. Scrub typhus is a hazard in many parts of South East Asia and beyond, and is the first of the rickettsial infections to show evidence of resistance to standard antibiotics.4 No useful vaccines are currently available for any of the rickettsial infections.In epidemics of louse borne typhus it is essential to treat all cases with doxycycline, and indeed to consider mass prophylaxis with this agent in the whole population at risk and for carers and medical workers on a weekly basis. All those at risk should initially be issued with clean clothes, which are dusted with powder containing 1% malathion or 1% permethrin. Again, this should include medical attendants, since history shows that they are at high risk.Endemic flea borne typhus can be controlled by antirodent measures, and individual use of insect repellent creams.
