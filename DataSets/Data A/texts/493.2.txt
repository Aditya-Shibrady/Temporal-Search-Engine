One of the first tissues the virus settles in is collagen. Collagen keeps the body�s organs in place, like an organic glue. Ebola eats away at collagen, causing all kinds of problems. The patient�s upper layer of skin ends up floating on a layer of liquefied tissue, resulting in tiny white blisters and red spots on the surface that can tear off with just a small amount of pressure. Rips in the skin can appear and spontaneous bleeding can occur from several orifices, including the eyes, nose and mouth.At the same time, immune cells called macrophages trigger coagulation, which forms small blood clots throughout the bloodstream, according to a study published in Cell Host & Microbe. Blood vessels all over the body begin to burst and leak, reducing the blood supply to the body�s vital organs. This circulatory failure deprives the organs of oxygen and causes them to shut down. The process is most severe in the liver.
