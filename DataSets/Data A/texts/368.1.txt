Cholera is transmitted through contaminated water and manifests itself as an acute infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Although Vibrios are free living in water (in fact, they can survive on algae for quite some time), they cause infection only in humans. The bacteria bind to the walls of the small intestine where they secrete a potent toxin. This toxin alters the membrane transport mechanism; instead of causing the water to leave the lumen of the gut and enter the tissues, large quantities of water, chloride, and sodium are drawn into the gut.
