This fact sheet explains CDCï¿½s updated Monitoring and Movement guidance to protect America from Ebola. The guidance focuses on how people who may have been exposed to Ebola are monitored and whether or not their movement needs to be limited. Through this guidance, CDC and state and local health departments seek to support people who may have been exposed to Ebola, as well as those who have not been exposed. The guidance helps to make sure a system is in place to quickly recognize when people who develop symptoms may need to be routed to medical care. These actions will better protect people who may have been exposed to Ebola and America as a whole.
