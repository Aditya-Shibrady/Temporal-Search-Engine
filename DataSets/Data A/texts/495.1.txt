Ebola-Reston, which is found in the Philippines, doesnï¿½t cause human disease, but all the others, which are found in Africa, do. Of these, the Zaire strain of Ebola is the most deadly, with a greater than 90% case fatality rate. It is the most feared of all the strains of Ebola virus, and quite rightly so. However, it should be remembered that the figure of 90% fatality is the case fatality rate with essentially no treatment. With modern medical care, the case fatality rate, even for Ebola-Zaire is more like 56%, which is still quite bad. In this specific outbreak, thus far the case fatality rate is around 57%.
