According to WHO, 65% of infant deaths due to cholera and related illnesses in developing countries could be prevented with clean drinking water and sanitation. Water Aid believes that the keys to prevent diarrheal illnesses�including cholera, typhoid and dysentery�are access to clean water, clean hands prior to mealtime and uncontaminated food supply. Hygiene education to create a locally sustainable solution to the global water and sanitation issue is another crucial aspect of the prevention of cholera. Water Aid strives to help reduce the risk of disease and thus begin to eliminate poverty by partnering with local groups to create locally sustainable solutions. If individual communities do not know how to achieve the foresaid hygienic practices, then the solution to the cholera problem will not be sustainable.Numerous countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas still suffer from cholera today. Typically the African region suffers the most from cholera outbreaks; however, there have been numerous large outbreaks in other regions of the world�the most recent being Haiti in 2010. While cholera is more prevalent in some countries than others, no country is exempt from the disease�it is a pandemic that transcends both geographical space and time. For more information on specific countries affected by cholera refer to the map below of reported cholera outbreaks in from 2007 to 2009. When many people think of cholera they think it is a disease of the past, strictly confined to the Industrial Revolution and Charles Dickens� novels. It is clear from statistics, however, that cholera is still a very active disease around the world, even if we are not directly affected by it. For more information on WaterAid visit www.wateraid.org
