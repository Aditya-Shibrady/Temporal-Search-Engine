Both Brantly and Writebol received doses of an experimental drug, called Zmapp, which includes man-made antibodies against Ebola virus. Although Zmapp has shown promise in animals, it has not yet been tested in humans. Experts have said it�s not possible to conclude that Zmapp cured their disease, although getting good supportive care at Emory, one of the world�s best hospitals, likely improved their chances of survival.
