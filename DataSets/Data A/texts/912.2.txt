Ebola virus is generally detectable in blood samples by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) within three days after the onset of symptoms; repeat testing may be needed for patients with symptoms for fewer than three days duration [51]. According to CDC guidelines for�discharging a person who is under investigation�for Ebola virus disease, a negative RT-PCR test that is collected =72 hours after the onset of symptoms excludes Ebola virus disease [52].
