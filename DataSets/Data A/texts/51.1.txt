Nancy Writebol was one of the first Americans to be diagnosed with and successfully treated for Ebola, the only other being Dr. Kent Brantly. Recently she was in Spokane visiting her son who lives in the area and we got an opportunity to sit down and speak with her and husband, David about their experience. Nancy and David had been already working in Liberia with the Humanitarian Relief Agency SIM when the recent Ebola epidemic hit.
