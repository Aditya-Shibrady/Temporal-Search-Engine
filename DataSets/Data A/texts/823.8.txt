Ohio is the latest state enacting stronger policies on those arriving from the afflicted West African countries. Those who were exposed to a "potentially infected person" must be quarantined at home, with daily health checks by a public health official for 21 days, the state's health department said. Anyone arriving from those countries who did not have exposure to anyone potentially infected must undergo daily health checks by a public health official for the 21 days and avoid public places.
