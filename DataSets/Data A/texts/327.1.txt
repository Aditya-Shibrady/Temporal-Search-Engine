If you're traveling to cholera-endemic areas, your risk of contracting the disease is extremely low if you follow these precautions: Wash hands with soap and water frequently, especially after using the toilet and before handling food. Rub soapy, wet hands together for at least 15 seconds before rinsing. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
