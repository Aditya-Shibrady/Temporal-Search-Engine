?We believe that Ebola�s first offensive maneuver is the targeting of certain types of immune cells which would normally be our body�s first line of defense against illness. The virus attacks and infects the body�s dendritic cells which are responsible for the activation of T cells (the white blood cells we use to fight infection) which would normally kill off the infected cells before they could spread. With the dendritic cells compromised, the T cells are not activated and the virus begins to multiply in a very rapid fashion. Ebola also, similarly too many other viruses, inhibits interferon which is a molecule that cells make use of to further retard viral reproduction.?After that it is somewhat a guessing game to the exact process, but what we do know is that virus attacks the connective tissue and reproduces at an extremely fast rate in the collagen (collagen is what keeps our organs where they belong), effectively digesting the tissue as it does this.Another major factor in the Ebola virus�s system wide attack on the body is its ability to form blood clots. Forming small clots early on, the virus causes the patient�s blood to slowly thicken, resulting in a decreased blood flow. As the clots begin to get stuck in the blood vessels, the patient begins to exhibit external signs in the form of red spots on the skin. As the disease progresses, these clots and their tell-tale spots increase in size. Another more serious effect of the Ebola virus�s clotting factor is the decreased blood supply to the vital areas of the body such as the liver, brain, kidneys, lungs, intestines, testicles and extremities.Entering the final stages of the disease�s progression, the patient may begin to exhibit spontaneous bleeding from their eyes, ears, nose as well as tears in the skin which can appear suddenly. Death generally occurs due to a catastrophic drop in blood pressure resulting from the damage done to the blood vessels and massive blood loss. Death may also occur due to multi-organ failure and/or shock.
