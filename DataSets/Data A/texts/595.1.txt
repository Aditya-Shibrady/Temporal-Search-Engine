The current cholera epidemic has gripped rural parts of Northern and Southern KwaZulu Natal since August 2000 in what has developed into the most serious epidemic yet experienced in South Africa. With the movement of peoplefrom province to province and between southern African countries, the cholera bacterium has now spread to seven of the nine provinces in South Africa. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry's Community Water Supply andSanitation Services section has developed a strategy to monitor the cholera outbreak and track the emergency water supply and sanitation intervention that each province is implementing to curb the spread of the disease.
