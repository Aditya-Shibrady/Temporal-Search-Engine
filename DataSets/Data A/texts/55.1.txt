Brantly, a missionary worker who contracted Ebola while treating patients in Liberia, was one of the first Americans to be successfully treated for the deadly virus. Since defeating the virus with the help of the experimental serumï¿½ZMapp, Brantly has helped saved others infected with Ebola by donating his blood. God bless this hero.
