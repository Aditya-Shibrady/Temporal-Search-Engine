During the incubation phase of the disease (6 to 24 weeks), patients may feel unwell with possible nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and headaches. Patients may then become jaundiced although low grade fever and loss of appetite may improve. Sometimes HBV infection produces neither jaundice nor obvious symptoms.The prevalence is lowest in countries with the highest standards of living, such as Great Britain, Canada, United States, Scandinavia, and some other European Nations.
