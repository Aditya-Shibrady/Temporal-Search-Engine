These immunogenicity data are difficult to extrapolate to children or to adults who have underlying immune suppression or high-risk conditions, for whom influenza vaccine is recommended. Experience with traditional seasonal vaccines tells us that the immune responses in older children, pregnant women, and immunocompetent adults with chronic conditions are roughly similar to those of healthy nonpregnant adults.6,7�On this basis, the new data suggest that the standard 15-�g HA dose of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine should be immunogenic in those groups. The immune responses in children are unknown.�
