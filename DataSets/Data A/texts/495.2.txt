Yes, Ebola is a very, very bad disease. Worse, there�s not much that even modern science-based medicine can do to treat the virus specifically. Basically, the treatment consists of supportive care: Fluid resuscitation to prevent dehydration, transfusion as needed to replace blood loss; treat the DIC with clotting factor replacement, and respiratory and cardiovascular support if needed. It�s true that there are experimental drugs that has shown promise in preclinical models, and the search for an Ebola vaccine has been put on the fast track, but as of now there is no approved treatment or vaccine for Ebola.So should we be bringing victims to the US for treatment?Treat in Africa or treat in the US?So are the concerns of Donald Trump and Mike Adams justified? One of the two Americans infected with Ebola (Dr. Kent Brantly) is already here. The second, Nancy Writebol, will leave Africa tomorrow. In considering whether bringing these patients back home is so dangerous that it shouldn�t have been done, it�s important to consider two things: how Ebola is transmitted and existing isolation protocols.
