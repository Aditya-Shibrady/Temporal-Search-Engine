Treating your home's walls with insecticide can help kill adult mosquitoes that come inside.Sleeping under a net. Bed nets, particularly those treated with insecticide, are especially recommended for pregnant women and young children.Covering your skin. During active mosquito times, usually from dusk to dawn, wear pants and long-sleeved shirts.Spraying clothing and skin. Sprays containing permethrin are safe to use on clothing, while sprays containing DEET can be used on skin.
