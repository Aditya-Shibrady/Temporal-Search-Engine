It depends on your destination's policies and your health at time of arrival. Some countries are screening travellers arriving from Ebola-affected areas for fever. People with elevated temperatures may be required to undergo further screening and may be directed to medical treatment. The World Health Organization advises that Ebola patients and their contacts should not travel internationally for 21 days (contacts) or until they test negative for Ebola twice after recovering (cases).
