From 1986 the 1989, a series of workshops was conducted by the United States Army Medical Research Unit-Malaysia(USAMRU-M) at the Malaysian Institute for Medical Research (IMR) to instruct medical technologists from Malaysia and neighboring countries in the serodiagnosis of those diseases.The shelf life of the IIP Test Kit was determined by periodically testing the kit reagents, control serum,and antigen slides monthly for the first year, then again at 18 and 24 months.Three clinical specimens of knowntiter to scrub typhus, typhus (murine), and spotted fever (tick typhus) groups were tested and monitored for lgG and IgM titer variability. Monitored kit materials were stored at the USAMRU-M at 4oC  and -20oC.
