Public health officials choose how and when to quarantine people based on a combination of factors, not just transmissibility alone. If they are not quarantined, contacts might travel into another province or state. Such travel makes it difficult to manage their condition or to perform further contact tracing. Also, they might get sick while away and thus introduce the disease into a new area (this happened in Nigeria, Spain and the United States). So, if someone has had a "high risk exposure" to a person with Ebola, that person will be asked to take certain measures even if they feel well. They will be asked to stay at home, limit movements, and monitor their health for 21 days. Public health officials will contact them daily to ask if they have any symptoms.
