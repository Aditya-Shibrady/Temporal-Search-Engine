Every district in Sierra Leone is now affected by the epidemic. New hotspots for the disease include the capital, Freetown, and the areas of Port Loko, Bombali, and Moyamba. The government has put five of the worst-affected districts under quarantine, setting up checkpoints on roads to prevent people leaving the areaï¿½measures which affect between one and two million people.
