During 1994�1996, no less than five independent active sites of Ebola virus transmission were identified: C�te d'Ivoire in 1994 [31]; DRC in 1995 [32]; and Gabon in 1994, 1995, and 1996 [3,�33�35]. The previously known Zaire subtype of Ebola virus (EBO-Z) and the newly discovered C�te d'Ivoire subtype (EBO-CI) were both involved, and as in previous African Ebola virus transmissions, the sites were in or near tropical forests, such as along riverine forests.
