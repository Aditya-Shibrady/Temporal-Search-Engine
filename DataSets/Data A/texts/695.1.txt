The risk for cholera is very low for people visiting areas with epidemic cholera. When simple precautions are observed, contracting the disease is unlikely.  Cholera disease causes a lot of watery diarrhea and vomiting.Cholera diarrhea can look like cloudy rice water. Cholera can cause death from dehydration (the loss of water and salts from the body) within hours if not treated.
