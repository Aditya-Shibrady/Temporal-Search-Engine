The World Health Organization/United Nations Children�s Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation monitors access to safe drinking water through the proxy indicator of improved drinking water sources, which are defined as �Those that are by nature of their construction protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with fecal matter� (10). During a cholera outbreak, water treatment and safe water storage are commonly recommended additional measures.
