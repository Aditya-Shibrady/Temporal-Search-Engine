To understand patterns of ongoing cholera transmission and seasonality of cholera in Haiti, and to assess the likelihood of future epidemics, it is essential to know whether environmental reservoirs of toxigenic V. cholerae O1 have been established, where these reservoirs are located, and what factors affect the occurrence and growth of the microorganism in the environment. We report the results of an initial year of monitoring of environmental sites in the Ouest Department of Haiti, near the towns of Leogane and Gressier, where the University of Florida(Gainesville, FL, USA) has established a research laboratory and field area.
