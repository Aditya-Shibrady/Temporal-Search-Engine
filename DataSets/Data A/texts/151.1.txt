Dr Perkins outlined the inherent limitations in the analytic sensitivity of LFIs and wondered if there might still be a role for them even if sensitivity is one or two logs (pfu/ml) lower than that of PCR, especially if such tests become readily available for implementation. He explained that while they are highly sensitive and specific, conventional non-automated RT-PCR tests have several limitations to their use in Ebola-affected countries because of the complexity of operation (and of the RNA extraction process) and the often slow manual relay of results. In this context, he noted the remarkable shift in the diagnostics industry in the past 10 years, particularly with the development of several near-patient molecular testing platforms that automate sample processing, amplification, and result reporting.
