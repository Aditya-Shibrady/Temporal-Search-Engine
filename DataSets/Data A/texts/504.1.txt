Malaria is a complex disease that firstly affects different organs and tissues and takes different forms. Severe malaria of childhood can present as severe malaria anemia (extremely low red blood cell numbers) or cerebral malaria (deep coma). Non-immune adults are susceptible to both of  these complications, in addition to multi-organ failure. A particularly severe form of malaria occurs only in pregnant mothers due to infected erythrocyte sequestration in the placenta that harms both mother and fetus.
