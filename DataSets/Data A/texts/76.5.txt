Both the oral fluid sample and the serum sample were analyzed for IgG antibodies using the ELISA assay and for Ebola virus using the antigen detection ELISA [8]. The specimens were examined for Ebola RNA by RT-PCR using primers derived from the L gene, as described elsewhere [9]. During the outbreak in Mbomo, we also detected Ebola RNA in the samples using the SmartCycler Technology (Cepheid) with L and NP gene-specific primers
