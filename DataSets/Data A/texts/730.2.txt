Malaria is a serious and occasionally fatal disease. It is caused by one of five different parasites in the Plasmodium family, and is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.There is no vaccine available against malaria. Chemoprophylaxis (anti-malarial medication) may be considered to prevent malaria.
