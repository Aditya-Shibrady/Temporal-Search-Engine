"1. What is malaria?Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted throughbite of an infected mosquito at night. There are two main types of malaria:Falciparum and Vivax. Falciparum malaria is the more severe type and can befatal. Vivax malaria is generally mild but can sometimes be fatal.2. What are common signs and symptoms of malaria?The common signs and symptoms of malaria consist of high fever, headache,chills and shivers, nausea and vomiting. In severe form of the disease the signsand symptoms included severe vomiting and diarrhoea, generalized convulsion,delirium and impaired consciousness, followed by persistent coma and may bedeath.3. How long is the incubation period?The incubation period in malaria means the time between mosquito bite and thefirst appearance of signs and symptoms, of which fever is the most common.Generally, the symptoms start approximately 9 to 14 days after the biting of aninfective mosquito. However, there are some types of malaria that the symptomsmay start one to two or several months after mosquito biting.4. Which parts of the body do the malaria parasites usually infect? Malaria parasites are initially injected into the skin capillaries (small blood vessels) bymosquito bites. From there the parasites travel via the bloodstream to the liver.Here in the liver the parasites develop and multiply before entering thebloodstream again. In the bloodstream the parasites invade the red blood cellswhere further reproduction occurs. From there other internal organs like brain;kidney etc. can be affected as clumps of heavily infected red blood cells start blocking small blood vessels (capillary) obstructing the blood flow therebycausing interruption in the normal functions of the organs affected."
