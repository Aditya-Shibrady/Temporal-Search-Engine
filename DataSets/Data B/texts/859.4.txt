This study was conducted between July 2003 and January 2005 at four hospitals in Thailand. Three hospitals are in the northeast part of the country (Udonthani Hospital, Udonthani Province, Maharat Nakhon Rachasima Hospital, Nakhon Rachasima Province, and Chaiyapoom Hospital, Chaiyapoom Province), and one hospital is in the south (Chumphon Hospital, Chumphon Province). Included in the trial were adult patients (age,  14 years) with suspected leptospirosis or scrub typhus�that is, patients who presented with acute fever (oral temperature, ?38.0�C for  15 days) in the absence of an obvious focus of infection and who in the opinion of the attending physician could receive oral antimicrobial treatment. Patients who were unable to take oral medications, those who were pregnant or breastfeeding, those with a history of allergy to macrolides or tetracyclines, those who had positive malarial blood smear, clinical dengue virus infection consistent with WHO criteria (16), severe leptospirosis- or scrub typhus-related complication, and those who had a definite history of receiving treatment active against leptospirosis or scrub typhus for more than 48 h before enrollment were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Subcommittee of the Public Health Ministry of Thailand, and written inform consent was obtained from all study volunteers.
