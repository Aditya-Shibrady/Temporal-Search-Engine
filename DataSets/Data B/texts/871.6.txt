Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services, along with a certain level of community engagement. The medical services include: rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper care and management of those who are infected and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial.Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans.This may be done by handling potentially infected bush meat only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it beforeconsumption.It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease.Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution.
