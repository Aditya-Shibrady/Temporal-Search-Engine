Ebola, like many viruses, works in part by inhibiting interferon�a type of molecule that cells use to hinderfurther viral reproduction. In a new study published today in Cell Host &amp; Microbe, researchers found that one of Ebola�s proteins, called VP24, binds to and blocks a transport protein on the surface of immune cellsthat plays an important role in the interferon pathway.
