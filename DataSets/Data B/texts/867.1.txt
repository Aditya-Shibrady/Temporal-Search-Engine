A second test on a patient held in isolation at the University of Kansas Hospital has come back negative for Ebola, essentially confirming to doctors that he does not have the disease. The patient, who had worked as medic on a boat off the coast of western Africa, came to the hospital after complaining of a fever and other symptoms. He was placed in an isolation unit as a precaution as doctors prepared to send samples to labs in Nebraska and Georgia.
