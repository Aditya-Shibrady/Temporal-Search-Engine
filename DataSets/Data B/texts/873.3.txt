On 8 August 2014, the WHO declared the epidemic to be an international public health emergency. Urging the world to offer aid to the affected regions, the Director-General said, "Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacityto manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own. I urge the international community to provide this supporton the most urgent basis possible."By mid-August 2014, Doctors Without Borders reported the situation in Liberia's capital Monrovia as "catastrophic" and "deteriorating daily". They reported that fears of Ebola among staff members and patients had shut down much of the cityï¿½s health system, leaving many people without treatment for other conditions.By late August 2014, the disease had spread to Nigeria, and one case was reported in Senegal. On 30 September 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola in the United States was diagnosed.The patient died 8 days later.
