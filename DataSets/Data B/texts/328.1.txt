If you're traveling to cholera-endemic areas, your risk of contracting the disease is extremely low if you follow these precautions: Drink only safe water, including bottled water or water you've boiled or disinfected yourself. Eat food that's completely cooked and hot and avoid street vendor food, if possible. Avoid sushi, as well as raw or improperly cooked fish and seafood of any kind.
