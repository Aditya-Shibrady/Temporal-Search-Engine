An Ebola patient in Sierra Leone will be transported to a hospital in Nebraska on Saturday if he is healthy enough to make the trip, hospital officials said on Thursday night. The patient, who recently tested positive for Ebola, would be the third person treated for the virus at Nebraska Medical Center�s special biocontainment unit in Omaha. The hospital said in a statement that that the man would be evaluated for possible treatment by a medical crew flying to Sierra Leone. �The members of the crew will determine whether the patient is stable enough for transport � if he is, he would arrive in Omaha sometime Saturday afternoon,� the statement said. The hospital previously treated two Americans: Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman released last month, and Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary released in September. Eight of the nine people treated for the virus in the United States have recovered from it.
