We can see the evidence at Philadelphia�s Lazaretto quarantine station, built in the aftermath of those devastating early epidemics.  When outbreaks hit non-endemic regions, yellow fever is fatal in 25-50 percent of cases. Yet only 22 percent of yellow fever patients died at the Lazaretto�s hospital. Typhus, which ravaged immigrants coming to America on the so-called �coffin ships� during the Irish famine of the late 1840s, kills 10-40 percent of its victims. At the Lazaretto, just 5 percent of typhus patients died. There were no miracle cures in the hospital there. Treatment consisted primarily of gentle tonics and laxatives, but these were supplemented by food and drink, clean clothing and bedding, rest, and nursing care.
