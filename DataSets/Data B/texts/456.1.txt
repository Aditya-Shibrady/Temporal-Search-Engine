A randomised clinical trial was carried out to explore the efficacy of single dose tetracycline therapy in cholera. One hundred and eighteen adult patients were assigned to receive either tetracycline in a single 1 g, or a single 2 g dose, or tetracycline 500 mg every six hours four times, or no antibiotics as controls. The means of total liquid stool volumes after treatment were lower in the single 1 g dose group (168.0 +/- 20.9 ml/kg), in single 2 g dose group (229.5 +/- 45.6 ml/kg), and multiple dose group (214 +/- 28.5 ml/kg), than in the control group (499.1 +/- 56.5 ml/kg) (p less than 0.05).
