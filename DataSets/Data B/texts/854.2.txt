Hutchison administered a simple treatment to alleviate cholera symptoms. Patients were given an emetic of salt and water to stop their vomiting and ease their stomachs. This enabled additional remedies to be given to them. Each received a single grain of calomel every hour. It was sprinkled on the backs of their tongues and washed down with ice water. Salivation was avoided. When stimulants were required, sulphuric ether was used. The amount needed depended upon its effects on the individual. Hot air baths, blistering, and spirits of turpentine (turpentine) were utilized externally, when necessary.
