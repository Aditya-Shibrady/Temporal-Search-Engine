Although cholera can be deadly if not treated, it is easily treatable. Your most important treatment is life-saving rehydration to replace the water and salts lost through diarrhoea and vomiting. The easiest way to do this is by taking oral rehydration salts. (Always include these in your medical kit.) Then seek medical help. A drip may be necessary.
