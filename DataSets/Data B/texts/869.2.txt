Norman said the patient, a man in his forties and lives in Kansas City, Kansas, had been kept in isolation at the hospital after showing several of the symptoms of the Ebola virus. The patient had been working as a medic on a private vessel off the west coast of Africa treating patients with many of the symptoms of the virus including high fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Norman said they�re waiting for final test results but believes the man may be suffering from some type of �tropical disease� such as Typhoid Fever or Typhus.
