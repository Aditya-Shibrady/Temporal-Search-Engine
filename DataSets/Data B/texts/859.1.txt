Patients with nausea and vomiting should be given anti emetic drugs to ensure adequate treatment. While high-grade fever frequently stimulates vomiting, this may be further aggravated by anti malarial drugs. Therefore it is better to avoid administration of oral antimalarials at the height of fever. One can wait for the fever to subside before taking the drugs. If the patient vomits within one hour of taking the anti malarial drugs, the same should be re-administered. In case of persistent vomiting, patient should be admitted and vomiting should be controlled with parenteral anti emetics. Parenteral anti malarials are needed only in cases of severe malaria or uncontrolled vomiting.
