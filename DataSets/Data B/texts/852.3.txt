Cholera Hospital was established on June 24, 1854, at Franklin Street in New York City.[1] The institution was built to treat cholera patients who were denied admittance to City Hospital in Manhattan during an onset of the disease in the summer of 1854.[2] The Mayor of New York, Jacob Westervelt, and the New York City Commissioners, took control of the building at 105 Franklin Street in anticipation of an eminent cholera epidemic.[3] A few weeks afterward a second hospital for cholera sufferers was opened at a schoolhouse on Mott Street (Manhattan). A book published by a New York physician in 1835 shows that a hospital called the Duane-Street Cholera Hospital existed in New York as early as 1835, but the relationship between the Duane-Street hospital and the Cholera Hospital at Franklin Street is unclear.
