In Ghana, MalariaCare is working in seven regions to improve malaria case management across the continuum of care�from communities to health facilities�and in both the public and private sectors. The project collaborates with the National Malaria Control Program and other partners to build case management capacity at all levels of the health system. Key activities include strengthening quality assurance (QA) and quality improvement systems and supporting routine systems for malaria monitoring and evaluation.
