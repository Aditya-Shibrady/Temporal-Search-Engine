Earlier in the day, the Shady Grove Adventist Hospital said: "Within the past 24 hours, we received a patient at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital that presented with flu-like symptoms and a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola.  Our care team immediately implemented guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure the appropriate tests and care for the patient as well as the safety of everyone within our facility.  We have procedures and equipment in our facility to safely handle patients with infectious conditions.  Per these guidelines the patient remains in isolation and is showing signs of improvement.   At this time, lab results indicate that this patient has another illness and we do not have a confirmed diagnosis of Ebola.
