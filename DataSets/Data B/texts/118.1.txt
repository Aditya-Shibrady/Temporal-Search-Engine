Real-time PCR testing for Ebola virus is available at more than 50 Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories located throughout the United States. LRN laboratories are currently using an FDAapproved Emergency Use Authorization assay to detect the Ebola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus). Samples that test positive using this assay are considered presumptive positive for Ebola Zaire RNA by real-time PCR and should be submitted to CDC for additional evaluation.
