Ebola is a virus that kills as many as 90 percent of those it infects.Symptoms may develop as soon as two days, or as late as 21 days, after infection. Victims experience the sudden onset of fever, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or fatigue. Vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and impaired kidney or liver function can all follow. The body�s number of platelets�blood-clotting cells�takes a nosedive, causing internal or external bleeding.
