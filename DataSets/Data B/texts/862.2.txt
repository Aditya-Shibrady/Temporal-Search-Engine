Sean G. Kaufman, who oversaw infection control at Emory University Hospital while it treated Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the first two US Ebola victims, called the earlier CDC guidelines �absolutely irresponsible and dead wrong.�. Speaking by phone from Liberia, where he was training workers for Samaritan�s Purse, the medical charity that Brantly and Writebol worked for, Kaufman said he had warned the agency as recently as a week ago that its guidelines were lax.
