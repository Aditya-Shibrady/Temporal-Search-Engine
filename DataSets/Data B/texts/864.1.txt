A surgeon who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone died at a Nebraska hospital Monday, his doctors said. Dr. Martin Salia, who was diagnosed with Ebola last week, arrived in Omaha on Saturday to be treated at the Nebraska Medical Center's biocontainment unit that has successfully treated two other Ebola patients this fall.
