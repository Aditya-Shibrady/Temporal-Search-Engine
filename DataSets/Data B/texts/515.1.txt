Cell entry and tissue damage ï¿½ After entering the body through mucous membranes, breaks in the skin, or parenterally, Ebola virus infects many different cell types. Macrophages and dendritic cells are probably the first to be infected; filoviruses replicate readily within these ubiquitous ""sentinel"" cells, causing their necrosis and releasing large numbers of new viral particles into extracellular fluid (figure 1) [6,96].
