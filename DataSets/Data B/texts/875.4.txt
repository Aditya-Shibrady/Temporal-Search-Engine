We believe that Ebola�s first offensive maneuver is the targeting of certain types of immune cells which would normally be our body�s first line of defense against illness. Another major factor in the Ebola virus�s system wide attack on the body is its ability to form blood clots. Forming small clots early on, the virus causes thepatient�s blood to slowly thicken, resulting in a decreased blood flow. Another more serious effect of the Ebola virus�s clotting factor is the decreased blood supply to the vital areas of the body such as the liver, brain, kidneys,lungs, intestines, testicles and extremities.
