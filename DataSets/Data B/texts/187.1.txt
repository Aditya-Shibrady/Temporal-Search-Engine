To evaluate the efficacy of erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in the treatment of cholera in children aged 1-8 years, a randomised clinical trial was conducted at a diarrhoea treatment centre in Bangladesh from December 1991 to June 1992. Fifteen children received erythromycin, 50 mg/kg per day, in four equally divided doses, 18 children received 10 mg/kg per day of trimethoprim and 50 mg/kg per day of sulphamethoxazole in two equally divided doses (12 hourly) for five days, and 15 children received no antibiotic; children in all three groups received intravenous cholera saline for severe dehydration and for mild to moderate dehydration
