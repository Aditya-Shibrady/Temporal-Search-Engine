Malaria protozoa can be traced back to before the evolution of mankind. The ancient Egyptians made references to the disease; Hippocrates detailed it; and the Romans were able to make use of it as a defence measure, the Campagna Romana marshes around their capital providing a debilitating barrier to would-be invaders. Malaria, especially of the Plasmodium vivax species, was once fairly common to temperate countries such as England, where the marshes of East Anglia provided breeding grounds for mosquitoes until the eighteenth century.
