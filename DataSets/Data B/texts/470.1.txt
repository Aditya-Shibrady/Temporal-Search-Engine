Patients with cholera recover even without an antibiotic if hydration is maintained, but antibiotics should be used for severely and moderately dehydrated patients to reduce purging and minimize the supply and logistical requirements for caring for a large patient population. During an epidemic in a resource-poor country, antibiotics save lives. They should not be used prophylactically, however, since such use encourages the spread of resistant strains.
