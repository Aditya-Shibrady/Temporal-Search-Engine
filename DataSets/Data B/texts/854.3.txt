Concomitantly, HAS received news that the densely populated city of St. Marc, ?20 km to the west along the Artibonite River, had a large number of persons with similar signs. Although cases of cholera had not been documented in Haiti for over a century (1), health care providers began to suspect cholera because of the patientsï¿½ clinical signs. On October 21, 2010, the National Laboratory of Public Health officially announced a cholera outbreak in the Artibonite region. In the days after seeing the initial cases, HAS developed a strategic plan to 1) create an isolated patient area, 2) train medical personnel in cholera treatment, 3) educate the population, and 4) improve poor sanitary conditions through latrine building in the community.
