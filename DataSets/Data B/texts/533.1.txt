"What happens to your body when you�re infected with Ebola? What is Ebola actually doing to your body?We�re still at a phase where we�re trying to understand all that Ebola does, but we know certain things that it definitely does do.First of all, Ebola cells seem to concentrate in the liver. But what we observe about Ebola is primarily because of its effects on the cells lining our blood vessels. And it does a number of things. It replicates, and disables the immune system, which allows the virus to escape detection, and escape the wrath of our immune system.  The second thing it does to the cell is that the cell itself becomes less functional, around the blood vessels. So the cells surrounding the blood vessels start to leak. That�s the source of the dehydration and the tremendous thirst that Ebola patients describe. That comes from the leakiness of the blood vessels.Then it kills those blood vessels. Eventually the virus replicates enough inside the cell, that instead of just putting out small particles as it does initially, it actually makes the cell explode."
