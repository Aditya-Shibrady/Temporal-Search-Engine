Cholera toxin attaches at the level of the crypts of Lieberkï¿½hn to enterocytes that have surface ganglioside Gm1, a special glycolipid. Internalization of the toxin-ganglioside complex then occurs. The bacterial enzyme catalyses the transfer of ADP ribose from intracellular NAD+ to the s subunit of the trimeric G protein that is normally attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane of each enterocyte. ADP ribosylation changes the activity of s subunit so it can no longer hydrolyze its bound GTP substrate, thus deregulating cyclic AMP activity. Hypersecretion immediately ensues. Efflux in chloride and bicarbonate ions into the small intestinal lumen pulls large quantities of water with it by passive osmosis. The process continues until no more toxin is produced, or until the enterocyte is shed into the lumen of the small intestin
