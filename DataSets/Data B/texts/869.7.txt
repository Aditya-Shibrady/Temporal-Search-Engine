Meanwhile, Howard University Hospital in Washington D.C. is still waiting for test results to determine whether or not a patient they admitted has the Ebola virus. Earlier on Friday, the hospital said they have a patient in isolation with Ebola-like symptoms. FOX 5 learned that patient is a Howard University student who recently traveled to Nigeria.
