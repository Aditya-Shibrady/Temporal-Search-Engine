In October 2000 an epidemic of Ebola broke out in Gulu, Uganda, and in 4 months it killed 224 people. Some doctors believe that eating ape meat contaminated with the virus may be one source of infection. It is hoped that research to determine the natural source of the virus and the ways in which it is transmitted to primates and humans will provide information about how to prevent future outbreaks.
