"Hemorrhage and disseminated intravascularcoagulation (DIC)Hemorrhage and DIC are prominent components of Ebola virus infection1. Rapid release of severalvasoactive agents, including cytokines, chemokines,histamines and peroxidases, from virus-infectedmonocytes and endothelial cells could evoke a shocksyndrome associated with DIC (Refs 1,25,27). Inparticular, elevated levels of TNF-afollowed by anincrease of endothelial permeability seem to play animportant role in the induction of circulatory shockduring filovirus infection25. Platelet-derived agentstriggered by damaged endothelial cells might alsocontribute to a shock syndrome. Conceivably, grossdamage of other organs, especially the liver, mightalso cause DIC by inducing thrombi formation inmultiple organs. Although the precise relation of DICto the overall pathogenesis of Ebola virus infection is unclear, the characteristic hemorrhagicmanifestation might be directly attributed to thiscoagulation defect."
