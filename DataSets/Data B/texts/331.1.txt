Health workers at all levels of the health system – hospitals, clinics, laboratories, health posts, laundries, transport – should be briefed on the nature of the disease and how it is transmitted, and strictly follow recommended infection control precautions. All staff handling suspected or confirmed cases of EVD or contaminated specimens and materials should use special personal protective equipment for working with biohazards, and apply hand hygiene measures according to WHO recommendations. If the recommended level of precaution is implemented, transmission of disease should be prevented.
