One of the primary failures of the immune system in regards the Ebola virus, is the inability to activate T-cells early in the course of the infection resulting in an insufficient humoral response which include both antibody and cytokine responses. Another result of the failure to activated T-cells adaquately is apoptosis of blood leukocytes. These characteristics of Ebola infection are commonly associated with fatalityin patients.
