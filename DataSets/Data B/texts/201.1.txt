The incubation period (the time between being bitten by the mosquito and developing symptoms) is variable ï¿½ usually between 2 and 3 weeks. However, in some cases it may take months for the disease to manifest itself. The initial symptoms are often similar to those of influenza: an intermittent mild fever headache muscle aches and chills, a general feeling of illness (malaise).
