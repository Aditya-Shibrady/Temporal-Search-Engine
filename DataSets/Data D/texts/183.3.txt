Antigen capture detected only 83% of those identified by PCR, and IgM only 67%. Ebola virus RNA was detected in all 13 fatalities, only 5 of whom had IgM and none IgG. RT-PCR detected Ebola RNA in PBMC one to three weeks after disappearance of symptoms when antigen was undetectable. RT-PCR was the most sensitive method and able to detect virus from early acute disease throughout early recovery.
