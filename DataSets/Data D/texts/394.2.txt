However, in a 2004 report, 20 of 93 patients with serologically confirmed scrub typhus had a delay in defervescence to more than 48 hours, making the reliability of this long-standing clinical truism suspect . The authors of another report retrospectively examined the clinical characteristics of 18 patients with Q fever (9), scrub typhus (7) or murine typhus (2) who failed to respond within 48 hours to treatment with doxycycline and compared their clinical features to 88 cases who responded promptly. Delayed defervescence was associated with jaundice and relative bradycardia.
