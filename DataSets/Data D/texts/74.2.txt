Patients with fatal disease usually develop more severe clinical signs early during infection and die typically between days 6 and 16 of complications including multiorgan failure and septic shock (mean of 7.5 days from symptom onset to death during the current outbreak in West Africa). In nonfatal cases, patients may have fever for several days and improve, typically around day 6. Patients who survive can have a prolonged convalescence. The case fatality proportion among patients with a known outcome in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is 70%; this proportion is 61% among hospitalized patients. Risk factors significantly associated with a fatal outcome in the affected countries in West Africa include: age >45 years old; unexplained bleeding; and a number of other signs and symptoms such as diarrhea, chest pain, cough, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, conjunctivitis, sore throat, confusion, hiccups, and coma or unconsciousness.
