 Prioritized Countries at Risk8(Cote dï¿½Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Senegal, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Togo). Implement WHO guidelines for preparedness9to respond to a possible outbreak of Ebola. Routine immunization services, vaccination campaigns (NIDs, SIAs) and vaccine-preventable disease surveillance should continue as planned using the normal safe injection and waste disposal practices.Instruct healthcare workers and vaccinators to be vigilant for anyone exhibiting signs or symptoms of EVD6and immediately isolate and report any suspected cases.Given the fear about Ebola, the public need reassurance through appropriate communication messages which highlight that (a) immunization services do not pose any special risk with respect to Ebola and (b) it is important that they bring children on time to receive their vaccinations against other diseases so that they remain healthy. As part of preparedness for a possible Ebola outbreak, areas with low immunization coverage should be identified and activities to increase immunization coverage in these areas should be planned and implemented. No changes to the collection, shipment and processing at the laboratories of specimens collected for vaccine-preventable disease surveillance are required.
