Chest x-rays show evidence of lung involvement. Blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) are usually evident in the urine. In some cases, particularly when scrub typhus is suspected, fluid from the spinal column (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) may reveal low numbers of mononuclear immune cells. Blood tests can also reveal abnormalities that reflect the involvement of other organs.
