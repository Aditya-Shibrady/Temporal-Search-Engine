One particular type of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is also able to modify the surface of red blood cells it infects. It causes these cells to become “sticky”, so they lodge in the small blood vessels leading up to major organs. This build-up is called sequestration, and results in reduced blood flow and oxygen deprivation in the organs.
