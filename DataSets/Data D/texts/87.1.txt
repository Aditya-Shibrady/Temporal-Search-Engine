In a statement from Emory about Ms. Writebolï¿½s admission, the hospital did not comment on the condition of Dr. Brantly or Ms. Writebol, who are believed to be the first two people ever treated for Ebola at a hospital in the United States. Their admissions have drawn widespread scrutiny, and Emory doctors and public health officials have repeatedly countered speculation that Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol could easily infect others with virus in the United States.
