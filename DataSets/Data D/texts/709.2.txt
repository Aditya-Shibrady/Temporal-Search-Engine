She said, "Unlike dengue or other viral illnesses, in Ebola we don't have the liberty to touch the patient due to high risk of transmission. We had to examine the patient from a distance without using a stethoscope or any other instrument. There is no way the caretakers can regularly monitor the patient physically or change the intravenous line." On the bright side, clinical experience of handling thousands of patients has helped experts devise strategies for infection control, the doctor added.
