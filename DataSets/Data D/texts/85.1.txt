But this week, after an extraordinary journey that captured the attention of the world, Nancy Writebol quietly walked out of Atlanta�s Emory University Hospital, where doctors declared her cured of the often-deadly infectious disease ebola and said she could return to a normal life with "no public health threat." Nancy Writebol�s recovery, along with that of Dr. Kent Brantly, a missionary with North Carolina-based Samaritan�s Purse, came in a surprise announcement Thursday at an Emory news conference in Atlanta. They are the first patients after ebola epidemic to successfully come out fully cured.
