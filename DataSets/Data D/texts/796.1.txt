Persons traveling or who have recently visited Africa especially West Africa, should be cautious and take measures to protect their health.  If a traveller becomes unwell with sudden onset of high fever, stomach pains, diarrhoea, rash or bleeding within three (3) weeks of being in any of these areas in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone), need to see a doctor right away. You must also inform the doctor about your travel history. Those who still decide to travel to West Africa are advised to adopt the following necessary precautions: practice frequent hand washing (e.g. after going to the toilet, or when hands are soiled); avoid direct contact with blood, secretions or other body fluids of infected living or dead persons or animals, as well as environments that have become contaminated with these infectious fluids such as soiled clothing, bed linen, or used needles.
