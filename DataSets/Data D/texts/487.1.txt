 The cholera germ enters the body via the mouth, usually in contaminated water or food, and sets up an infection in the small intestine. The incubation period is short, never longer than five days and sometimes less than one.The disease usually developed in three relatively well-defined stages; the stage of evacuation, the stage of collapse and the stage of reaction. The onset was invariably abrupt and characterised by a purging diarrhoea and copious vomiting, which emptied the stomach and was followed by exhausting retching and hiccuping. As the body became dehydrated, agonising cramps afflicted legs, arms, abdomen and back.As the patient passed into the stage of collapse his physical appearance changed completely - his skin became lax, wrinkled, cold and clammy to touch, his eyes sunken, his cheeks hollow, and there was blueness about the eyes and lips. The voice became husky, the expression anxious and apathetic. His blood pressure fell and he was unable to urinate. At this stage death could occur from circulatory failure or failure of bodily functions.
