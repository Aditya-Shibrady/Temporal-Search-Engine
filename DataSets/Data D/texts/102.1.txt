In late July, when it looked like Dr. Kent Brantly wasn�t going to make it, a small news item escaped Liberia. It spoke of Brantly�s treatment � not of the Ebola vaccine, Zmapp, which Brantly later got. But of a blood transfusion. He had "received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy who had survived Ebola because of Dr. Brantly�s care," the missive said. Now months later, Brantly, who has since recovered from his battle with the virus, has passed on the favor. Nancy Writebol who is the other person who got cured of ebola also offered her blood for transfusion. They both are the first individuls to successfully cured of ebola and their blood should haave antibodies which might cure ebola virus.
