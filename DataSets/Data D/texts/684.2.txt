One step recommended by the World Health Organization is the education of the general public of the risk factors for Ebola infection and of the protective measures individuals can take. These include avoiding direct contact with infected people and regular hand washing using soap and water. Bush meat, an important source of protein in the diet of some Africans, should be handled with appropriate protective clothing and thoroughly cooked before consumption. Traditional burial rituals, especially those requiring washing or embalming of bodies, should be modified to maintain a proper protective barrier. Social anthropologists may help find alternatives to traditional rules for burials. Airline crews are instructed to isolate anyone who has symptoms resembling Ebola virus disease.
