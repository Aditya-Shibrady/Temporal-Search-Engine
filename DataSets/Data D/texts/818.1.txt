Immigration on this scale was unprecedented in Canadian history, and it occurred at a time when major epidemics were ravaging Europe. Ships arriving in America carried smallpox, measles, scarlet fever and other fever illnesses. Asiatic cholera, a new and deadly disease that spread like wildfire, had been raging through Europe since 1829 and raising fears on this side of the ocean. Newcomers to Canada were thought to be bringing the disease with them. The colonial authorities quickly passed health control measures for these immigrants. On February 25, 1832, the House of Assembly of Lower Canada passed a law establishing a quarantine station at Grosse ï¿½le.
