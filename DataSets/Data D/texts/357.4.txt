Typhus is diagnosed primarily from history and symptoms. Blood tests (serologic tests) are used to assess severity and exclude other possible diagnoses. Specific tests (complement fixation, immunofluorescence) performed on blood serum drawn 5 to 12 days after onset of symptoms can detect antibodies for Rickettsia prowazekii, but treatment usually begins before this test can be performed.
