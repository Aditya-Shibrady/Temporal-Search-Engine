In the context of UNICEF s new West Africa Accelerated Child Survival Programme, work is being carried out in conjunction with the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure effective monitoring and evaluation of the  high impact intervention packages  for women and children. As malaria interventions are important components of these packages,lessons learned through this M&amp;E process will inform and strengthen that for the RBM partnership as a whole. It is important to remain prudent in the selection of indicators and to ensure that data are used ultimately for improving programmes. Tools and participatory methods for community monitoring and data collection need to be further developed and utilized.
