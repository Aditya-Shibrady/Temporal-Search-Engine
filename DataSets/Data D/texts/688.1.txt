Malaria caused an estimated 207 million cases and 627,000 deaths in 2012, mostly young children in sub-Saharan Africa. It contributes to poverty; in Africa alone, costs of illness, treatment, and premature death from malaria are at least $12 billion per year.Malariaï¿½s toll would be much higher without the efforts of CDC and other global partners. From 2000 through 2012, the massive scale-up of malaria prevention and treatment interventions saved approximately 3.3 million lives globally, and malaria death rates in Africa were cut nearly in half. However, malaria remains a major public health problem, even though it is both preventable and treatable. Malaria is spread by the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito. The disease can cause fever, chills, and flu-like illness. If it is not treated, it may cause severe complications and death.
