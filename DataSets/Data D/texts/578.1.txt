The Roll Back Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) was established in 2003in order to provide expert guidance on monitoring and evaluation for malaria at the global, regional and national levels.[36] To date, MERG has provided guidance on technical issues related to monitoring malaria control activities. Notably, this work has resulted in the development of a core set of indicators and standard data collection methods to ensure consistency and harmonization in malaria information reported through major national-level household surveys.[37] Since 2000, data on these core set of indicators have been routinely collected through the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). The MIS was developed by MERG and its partners. Its development informed the malaria sections of both the MICS and the DHS surveys. All surveys are now being implemented in numerous countries across Africa.[38] This data collection has allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of progress of key malaria control interventions.
