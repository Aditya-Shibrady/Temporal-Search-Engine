Several people have developed antibodies (or "seroconverted") to Ebola Reston,but did not become noticeably ill. Still, it is too soon to assume Reston is harmless in humans. �Some people have seroconverted but we don�t really know much about that. All you can say is there hasn�t really been any human that has gotten really sick or died from it.But the �n� [number infected] is quite small.�
