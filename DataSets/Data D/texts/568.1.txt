It takes too long for Ebola to be diagnosed, and by then the secondary symptoms may have set in: diarrhea, red eyes,vomiting blood, gastrointestinal bleeding from the mouth or rectum, hemorrhaging from the nose and mouth, and bleeding in the brain that may lead to seizures and delirium. After the presentation of these symptoms and a miserable week or so, patients either recover or die from systemic multi-organ failure. While the visible hemorrhaging is what gives thevirus its name, it actually presents in less than half of the patients infected with Ebola.
