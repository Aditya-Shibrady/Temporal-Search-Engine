For pregnant women diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum infection, prompt treatment with either mefloquine or a combination of quinine sulfate and clindamycin is recommended. Quinine treatment should continue for 7 days for infections acquired in Southeast Asia and for 3 days for infections acquired elsewhere; clindamycin treatment should continue for 7 days regardless of where the infection was acquired.
