The bacteria cause inflammation of the intestine (gastroenteritis) and thus are a common cause of diarrhea. Sometimes the bacteria enter the bloodstream (causing bacteremia) and spread, causing infections or collections of pus (abscesses) at distant sites, such as the bones, joints, urinary tract, and lungs.
