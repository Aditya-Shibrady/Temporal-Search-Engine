The virus causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which is a serious and usually fatal disease for those who contract it. It damages the endothelial cells that make up the lining of the blood vessels and creates difficulty in coagulation of the infected individualâ€™s blood. As the vessel walls become more damaged, and the platelets cannot coagulate, the individual undergoes hypovolemic shock, or a dramatic decrease in blood pressure.
