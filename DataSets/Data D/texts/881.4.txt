I think it was on Friday 21 March around 7 pm that it was identified as Ebola but it was not until Saturday late evening I got the text that confirmed it was Ebola Zaire. I was sitting in a restaurant and I remember thinking this was the worst case scenario for the country. No-one wants this to be Ebola - and if it is Ebola they want it to be the Cote dï¿½Ivoire strain, because the only case of that survived. There is a lot of stigma around Ebola Zaire.
