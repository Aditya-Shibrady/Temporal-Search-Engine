Epidemic and endemic typhus is sometimes misdiagnosed as typhoid fever in tropical countries. Similarly, co-infection of typhoid and typhus fever can be overlooked if not suspected clinically. High continued fever with variable associated symptoms, such as malaise, headache, and myalgia, are usually present in both typhoid and typhus fever. Jaundice and malena may also be present in some cases of both typhoid and typhus fever. However, signs such as subconjunctival haemorrhage should lead to a different aetiology of fever being considered, including typhus fever. Therefore, clinical suspicion is of paramount importance in the diagnosis of both typhoid and typhus fever. Confirmation of the diagnosis is important as the treatment is different but may not always be possible. In most cases of typhus, treatment is given based on clinical suspicion or a positive Weil-Felix test. In clinically-suspected cases of typhus fever, a rising titre of OXK,OX2, and OX19 antigens supports the diagnosis but confirmation of the diagnosis may be difficult. Isolation of Salmonella Typhi from blood confirms the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Here, we present a case of typhoid feverwith a co-infection of typhus fever in a patient recently admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR,B.
