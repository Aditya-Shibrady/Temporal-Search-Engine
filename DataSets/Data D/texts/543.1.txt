Aside from the human cost, the outbreak has severely eroded the economies of the affected countries. A Financial Times report suggested the economic impact of the outbreak could kill more people than the virus itself. As of 23 September, in the three hardest hit countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, only 893 treatment beds were available even thoughthe current need was 2122 beds. In a 26 September statement, the WHO said, "The Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times. Never before in recorded history has a biosafety levelfour pathogen infected so many people so quickly, over such a broad geographical area, for so long."The WHO reported that by 25 August more than 216 health-care workers were among the dead, partly due to the lack of equipment and long hours.On 23 October, the Malian government confirmed its first case.In response, UNMEER, in cooperation with the LogisticsCluster, air-lifted 1,050 kg of personal protective equipment (PPE) and body bags from Monrovia to Mali.As of 19 November 2014, 15,351 suspected cases and 5,790 deaths had been reported;however, the WHO has said that these numbers may be vastly underestimated.
