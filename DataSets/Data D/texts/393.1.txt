Give antibiotics for five days or for 2-4 days after fever has subsided. An alternative strategy in outbreak situations is to give patients a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline, although there may be a higher risk of relapse with this approach.In patients with severe, acute disease, management on a high-dependency area with support measures may be needed. Recrudescent cases of epidemic typhus will usually be cured by a single further course of antibiotics.
