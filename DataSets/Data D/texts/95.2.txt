John's commitment to helping the people of Liberia is inspiring," said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA. "When his SIM colleague Rick Sacra became ill with Ebola, John said, �send me back in.' He has worked tirelessly over the past two months providing essential medical and administrative services at our ELWA Hospital, including treatment of malaria patients and delivering babies � services which are scarcely available. Last week he reported that our hospital was one of the only hospitals open in the capital of 1.5 million people."
