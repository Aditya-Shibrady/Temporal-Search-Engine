Countries with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone). As a result of the Ebola crisis, regular health services, including immunization, have been greatly reduced or stopped due to shortage of healthcare workers, fear, and the massive disruption of daily life. In situations where this has occurred consideration should continuously be given to the possibility of reinstating immunization services at the earliest possible time. Any disruption of immunization services, even for short periods, will result in an increase in the number of susceptible individuals, and will increase the likelihood of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Cases of measles4are being reported in the Ebola affected countries and there is a growing risk of significant measles outbreaks. This will further overload the barely functioning health services, and inevitably result in deaths particularly among children.? For the moment, to avoid mass gatherings, vaccination campaigns (NIDs, SIAs) are advised to bepostponed until the country has been declared Ebola free (42 days without detection of any new cases5).? However, where and whenever routine vaccination is possible (e.g. unaffected districts, private practice, NGO services, other) health workers should:o Apply standard precautions (Annex 1) when vaccinating ANY PERSON. Hand hygiene is the most important measure (rubbing with an alcohol-based formulation (hand sanitizer)or if not available, hand washing with soap). Gloves should be worn and changed for each person vaccinated.o Use the case definitions to screen for EVD6by asking if they have experienced any of the signs or symptoms, or if they have had contact with persons infected with EVD (e.g. family members, etc). DO NOT VACCINATE ANYONE SUSPECTED OF EVD OR EXPOSED TO EVD7.o Use �one-time/one-person only� auto-disable syringes.o Observe strict safe injection and waste disposal practices (e.g. no recapping, immediate disposal of needle and syringe into safety box; disposal by high-temperature incineration or burying).o For the administration of oral vaccines (e.g. OPV) ensure that the vaccine dropper does not at any time come in contact with the child�s mouth.
