Epidemic typhus is very rare in the US; only about 15 cases are reported annually (Hansen). Epidemic typhus outbreaks still occur in other parts of the world, particularly in the highlands and cold sections of Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. About 100 cases of endemic typhus are reported in the US each year, although this form tends to be under-reported. Most cases occur in the Gulf States, particularly in south Texas. Scrub typhus does not occur in the US, so the only US cases arise from travelers who are infected overseas. Scrub typhus occurs only on the Indian subcontinent, on some islands in the western Pacific and in northern Australia.
