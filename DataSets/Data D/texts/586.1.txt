The Austro-Hungarian military knew all too well the dangers of typhus in wartime, however.Typhus was endemic in Austrian-held Poland and northeastern Bosnia (near Tuzla). Recruits from these areas, where disease-bearing lice were common and widespread, would spread the disease when deployed to other parts of the Imperial Monarchy. Austro-Hungarian authorities treated the disease as endemic, and monitored it closely.
