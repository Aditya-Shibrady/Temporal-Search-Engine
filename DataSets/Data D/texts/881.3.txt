The first emails received from Guinea were mentioning suspected cases of Lassa fever. The first emails just gave numbers (9 cases including 8 fatalities) but on 18 March we had a more detailed description. I was a little irritated because in the description they were talking about transmission following funerals and among health care workers which is something that you have for Ebola but is rare for Lassa fever.
