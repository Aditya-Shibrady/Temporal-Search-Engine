India has not got a single case of Ebola so far but experts lay stress on high levels of preparedness in case the disease spreads here too. "One single case is enough to trigger an epidemic-like situation," said Gomathinayagam, who works with humanitarian organization Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF). She spent nearly six weeks in Foya town of Liberia where MSF has set up a 40-bed facility to treat patients infected with the deadly virus."There is no specific treatment or vaccine with proven efficacy for Ebola. Treatment is limited to supporting therapy- hydrating the patient, monitoring their oxygen status and BP, and controlling infections," said the doctor, who specializes in community medicine. "Nearly 37% of the Ebola patients admitted at our centre have survived," said Martin Sloot, general director, MSF India. Peter Piot, who discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, has said in his recent interviews that Ebola poses a serious threat to countries like India on account of its huge population and limited health infrastructure.
