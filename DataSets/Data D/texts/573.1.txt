In Sacramento County, health officials are monitoring two people who recently traveled to West Africa, where the Ebolaoutbreak is centered, but officials said neither person is showing symptoms and neither has been hospitalized."Our directive to all of the hospitals is that they need to be prepared to take care of an Ebola patient at leastfor a minimum of two days because that's about how long it would take for us to get a definitive diagnosis," saidDr. Olivia Kasirye, Sacramento County's health officer.
