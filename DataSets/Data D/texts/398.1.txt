Patients will be hospitalized for full 5 days, and asked to return for a follow up evaluation 7 days after discharge. After initial rehydration, patients will be observed for 4 hours, and only those with 20 ml/kg of watery stools during this period will be enrolled for study. Treatment will be random, and blinded to study staff and patients.
