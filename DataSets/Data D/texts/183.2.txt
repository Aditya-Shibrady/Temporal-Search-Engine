Twenty-six laboratory-confirmed patients during and 5 after the acute phase of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, 15 healthy controls and 20 febrile patients not infected with Ebola virus were studied. RT-PCR results were compared with ELISA antigen capture, and Ebola specific IgM and IgG antibody detection. Ebola virus RNA was amplified from 26/26 specimens from the acute phase, 3/5 during recovery, 0/20 febrile patients and 1/15 negative controls. Sensitivity of RT-PCR in identifying acute infection and early convalescence compared with antigen or IgM detection was 100% and 91% respectively, and specificity compared with antigen detection and IgM assay combined was 97%.
