CDC recommends that U.S. residents avoid nonessential travel to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. If you must travel (for example, to do for humanitarian aid work in response to the outbreak) protect yourself by following CDC�s advice for avoiding contact with the blood and body fluids of people who are ill with Ebola.Travel notices are designed to inform travelers and clinicians about current health issues related to specific destinations. These issues may arise from disease outbreaks, special events or gatherings, natural disasters, or other conditions that may affect travelers� health. A level 3 alert means that there is a high risk to travelers and that CDC advises that travelers avoid nonessential travel.
