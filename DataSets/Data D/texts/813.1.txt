"There is extremely low risk, in my judgment, of this individual contracting Ebola," Shumlin said. "However we're going to take every precaution to keep the public safe and to act in this individual's best interest." The man is a Rutland resident, city Mayor Christopher Louras wrote in a statement, which he posted on his Facebook page about 30 minutes after the conference. Shumlin said the quarantine is taking place in Vermont but outside a health care facility. The man is housed in a "safe, rural setting" with a law enforcement presence. He will be monitored for 21 days, the governor said.
