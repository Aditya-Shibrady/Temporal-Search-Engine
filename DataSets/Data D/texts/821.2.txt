The doctor assembled the passengers and crew on the upper deck to look for any early symptoms that might indicate disease, such as a fever or rash. He then examined any sick persons confined to the steerage area or in the ship's infirmary. Lastly, he determined the state of health on board the ship. Based on this information, the doctor decided whether to issue the ship the necessary certificate to enter the Port of Quï¿½bec and let it continue, or place it under quarantine.
