Between January and June 1995, Kikwit, a city 525 km southeast of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), was the epicenter of an outbreak of Ebola (EBO) hemorrhagic fever (EHF) [1]. During the epidemic, 316 cases of EHF were identified. The overall case fatality rate (80%; 249/311) [2] was comparable to rates observed during other epidemics (53% during the 1976 outbreak in southern Sudan, 88% during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak in DRC, and 53% during the February 1996 outbreak in Gabon)
