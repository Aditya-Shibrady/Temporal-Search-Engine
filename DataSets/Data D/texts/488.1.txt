Typhoid fever is an infection caused by the germ (bacterium) Salmonella typhi. This can cause a serious illness which can be fatal if not treated rapidly with antibiotics.The germs (bacteria) enter your body through the gut. They sit in your immune system (glands and lymph vessels) and multiply there. They then enter the bloodstream, which is when most people experience symptoms of headache and high temperature (fever). Through the bloodstream they enter various organs, particularly the liver, spleen, gallbladder and bone marrow. Because bile produced by the gallbladder is squirted into the gut, the bowels then get infected again.
