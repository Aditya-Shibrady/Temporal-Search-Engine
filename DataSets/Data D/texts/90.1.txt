Brantly and Writebol have been hospitalized in serious condition in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. Brantly was brought back to the United States first, in a specially equipped �air ambulance� to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has one of four facilities in the country designed to handle such cases. They were released after being successfully treated earlier this week. Both walked out with healthy smile.
