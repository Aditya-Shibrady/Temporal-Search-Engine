Additionally, the CDC recommends that travelers practice enhanced precautions in Congo (also known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in central Africa. Cases have been reported only in the Equateur Province, but travelers should keep abreast of reports in the event that it spreads further in Congo. The outbreak is not related to those in other countries and can be traced to one person who prepared contaminated bushmeat. Travelers there should avoid wild animals and raw or undercooked bushmeat, as well as take to heart the well-known advice to avoid the body fluids of those infected with the virus.
