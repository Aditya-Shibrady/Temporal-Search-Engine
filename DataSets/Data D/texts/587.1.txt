Retrospective data were collected from patients registered at two university-affiliated tertiary care hospitals in the north of Thailand, from 2004 to 2010. Key information was retrieved from in-patient records,out patient cards, laboratory reports and registers. Patients were classified into three severity groups: nonsevere, severe (those with at least one organ involvement), and deceased. Prognostic characteristics for scrub typhus severity were analyzed by a multivariable ordinal continuation ratio regression.Patients suspicious of scrub typhus with low body temperature, rapid pulse rate, presence of crepitation, low percentage of lymphocyte, low serum albumin, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, elevated serum creatinine,and positive urine albumin should be monitored closely for severity progression.
