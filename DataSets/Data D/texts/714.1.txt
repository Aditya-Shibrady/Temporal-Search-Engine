In the current outbreak in West Africa, the majority of cases in humans have occurred as a result of human-to-human transmission.Infection occurs from direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, or other bodily fluids or secretions (stool, urine, saliva, semen) of infected people. Infection can also occur if broken skin or mucous membranes of a healthy person come into contact with environments that have become contaminated with an Ebola patient�s infectious fluids such as soiled clothing, bed linen, or used needles.More than 100 health-care workers have been exposed to the virus while caring for Ebola patients. This happens because they may not have been wearing personal protection equipment or were not properly applying infection prevention and control measures when caring for the patients. Health-care providers at all levels of the health system � hospitals, clinics, and health posts � should be briefed on the nature of the disease and how it is transmitted, and strictly follow recommended infection control precautions.
