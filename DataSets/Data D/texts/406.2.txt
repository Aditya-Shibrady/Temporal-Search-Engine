Typhus is treated with antibiotics. Medication may also be prescribed to reduce fever (antipyretics) and relieve muscle aches (analgesics). Severe headaches may require a narcotic pain reliever. Bed rest is necessary for recovery. Any remaining lice, fleas, or mites should be removed and the individual isolated in a clean environment free from rodents. Supportive care may be necessary depending on the involvement of other organ systems. Although symptoms may recur, they are usually responsive to antibiotic therapy.
