Organ cultures prepared from tracheas that were either infected with hog cholera virus (HCV)in vitroor collected from HCV-infected swine supported replication of the virus. Replication was confirmed by an increase in the titer of extracellular virus as well as by the appearance and increase in the number of fluorescent cells observed in the tracheal epithelium.
