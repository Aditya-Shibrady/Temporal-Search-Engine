1. U.S. hospitals or clinical laboratories concerned about a patient with potential Ebola virus exposure should contact their local and/or state public health authorities. These agencies will work with CDC to determine whether a patient is or is not a PUI, and whether testing is indicated. Patient status should be determined as quickly as possible in order to ensure that patient care is not compromised.
