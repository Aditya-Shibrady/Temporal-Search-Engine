Epidemics of Ebola virus disease are generally thought to begin when an individual becomes infected through contact with the meat or body fluids of an infected animal. Once the patient becomes ill or dies, the virus then spreads to others who come into direct contact with the infected individualï¿½s blood, skin, or other body fluids. Studies in laboratory primates have found that animals can be infected with Ebola virus through droplet inoculation of virus into the mouth or eyes [61,62], suggesting that human infection can result from the inadvertent transfer of virus to these sites from contaminated hands.
