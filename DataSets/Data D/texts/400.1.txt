Convalescence from EVD is long and often associated with sequelae such as myelitis, recurrent hepatitis, psychosis, or uveitis. Data on the post-recovery viraemic period are limited. Shedding of Ebola virus has been reported in breast milk and semen after the virus has been cleared from blood [4]. Viable virus has been isolated from semen up to seven weeks after recovery.
