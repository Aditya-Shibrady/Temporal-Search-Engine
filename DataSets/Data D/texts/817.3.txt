More than 100 soldiers returning to the Philippines from a peacekeeping mission in Liberia, the country hardest hit by an Ebola epidemic in West Africa, will be quarantined on a secluded island, a military spokesman said Tuesday. The 112-member peacekeeping contingent is due to arrive in Manila on November 11. The military initially planned to quarantine them at a military facility in the northern province of Tarlac.
