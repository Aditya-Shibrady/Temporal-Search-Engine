Ebola announced itself in 1976 with two simultaneous epidemics, though they were, in fact, different strains of the virus: Sudan ebolavirus (Sudan virus) and Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus). In Sudan, there were 284 cases and 151 deaths, for a fatality rate of 53 per cent; in Zaire, that rate was 88 per cent, with the virus killing 280 of the 318 people diagnosed.
