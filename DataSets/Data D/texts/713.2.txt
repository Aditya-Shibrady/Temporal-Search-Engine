Nigeria and Senegal were the first African countries in this category; however, swift and effective responses contained and stopped Ebola transmission. As of 17 October and 20 October respectively, the outbreaks in both countries have been officially declared over by WHO and surveillance systems heightened for timely identification of possible re-introduction of cases.? In areas without cases, routine immunization services, vaccination campaigns (NIDs, SIAs) and vaccine-preventable disease surveillance should continue as planned using the normal safe injection and waste disposal practices.? Instruct healthcare workers and vaccinators to be vigilant for anyone exhibiting signs or symptoms of EVD6and immediately isolate and report any suspected cases. The current Ebola triage systems in all health facilities should be maintained.? Given the fear about Ebola, the public need reassurance through appropriate communication messages which highlight that (a) immunization services do not pose any special risk with respect to Ebola and (b) it is important that they bring children on time to receive their vaccinations against other diseases so that they remain healthy.? In areas with cases, or with localized transmission, follow procedures outlined in (1) above. Once the Ebola outbreak is over (42 days without detection of any new cases) and normal health services resume, it will be necessary to plan and conduct multi-antigen catch-up campaigns to vaccinate children who missed their scheduled vaccines.? As part of preparedness against the further spread of Ebola, areas with low immunization coverage should be identified and activities to increase immunization coverage in these areas should be planned and implemented.? No changes to the collection, shipment and processing at the laboratories of specimens collected for vaccine-preventable disease surveillance are required.
