Adequate antibiotic therapy initiated early in the first week of illness is highly effective and is associated with the best outcome. Fever usually subsides within 24-72 hours after starting antibiotic therapy. If fever fails to subside with the use of a suitable antibiotic, the diagnosis of rickettsial disease should be reconsidered. Treatment may be terminated 2-3 days after the patient is afebrile and at least 10 days of therapy has been given.
