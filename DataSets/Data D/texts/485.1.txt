In November 1994 after 15 years of epidemiologic silence, Ebola virus reemerged in Africa and, for the first time, in West Africa. In Cï¿½te d'Ivoire, a 34-year-old female ethologist was infected while conducting a necropsy on a wild chimpanzee. Eight days later, the patient developed a syndrome that did not respond to antimalarial drugs and was characterized by high fever, headache, chills, myalgia, and cough. The patient had abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and a macular rash, and was repatriated to Switzerland. The patient suffered from prostration and weight loss but recovered without sequelae.
