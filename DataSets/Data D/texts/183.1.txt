This study reports the first field evaluation of a new diagnostic technique for Ebola virus disease with sensitivity and specificity. Ebola virus causes rare but fulminating outbreaks in Equatorial Africa. Rapid differentiation from other infections is critical for timely implementation of public health measures. Patients sually die before developing antibodies, necessitating rapid virus detection. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was eveloped, implemented and evaluated at Centre International de Recherches Mï¿½dicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon, to detect Ebola viral RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
