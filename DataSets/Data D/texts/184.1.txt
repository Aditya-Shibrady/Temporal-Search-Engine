Ebola haemorrhagic fever presents as a viral prodrome with a high potential for differential diagnosis, especially early in outbreaks. The initial diagnosis of this syndrome is based on clinical assessment. Therefore, proper contingency plans should be developed. Several imported cases of the closely related Marburg virus have been reported in Europe and the USA.92�and�93�Ebola haemorrhagic fever can be suspected in acute febrile patients with the symptoms described and with a history of travel to an endemic area, if they present with fever and constitutional symptoms. Identification might be difficult because severe and acute febrile diseases can have a wide range of causes in areas endemic for Ebola virus, with the most prominent being malaria and typhoid fever followed by others such as shigellosis, menigococcal septicaemia, plague, leptospirosis, anthrax, relapsing fever, typhus, murine typhus, yellow fever, Chikungunya fever, and fulminant viral hepatitis.
