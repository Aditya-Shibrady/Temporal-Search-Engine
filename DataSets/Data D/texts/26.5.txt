To minimize risk to personnel, a site-specific risk assessment must be performed by the laboratory director, safety officer, and other responsible persons prior to receiving specimens in order to determine the potential for exposure from sprays, splashes, or aerosols generated during all laboratory processes, procedures, and activities. Risks should be mitigated by implementing engineering controls, administrative and work practice controls, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
