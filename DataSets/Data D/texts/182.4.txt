The treatment of EBO-infected patients consists mainly of palliative treatment and treatment to avoid cardiovascular collapse and renal insufficiency. During the initial phase of the EBO epidemic in Kikwit, very little patient care was offered. The priority was to stop the epidemic and to avoid further spread among health care workers. For this reason, protective equipment was distributed and invasive procedures were avoided.
