The Ebola virus is a systemic infection. What this means is that every organ and tissue, except the bones and skeletalmuscles, are under constant attack. The Ebola HF is marked by blood clotting and hemorrhaging. We have still not completelyfigured out exactly how the virus works. One theory is that the virus particles may release proteins which weaken the body�s immune system response thus rendering it unable to defend itself.
