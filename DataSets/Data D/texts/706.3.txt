The treatment stays the same. It is conservative treatment. Isolate the patient, maintain blood parameters, maintain blood pressure and so on. So Internal Medicine specialists will be equipped to provide care to the patient. The problems arise when complications set in. And for that, what is necessary is an ICU set-up.The first and foremost requirement is to isolate the patient. And what is needed are designated wards. You canï¿½t keep an Ebola patient in a normal ICU ward because the chance of spread of infection is so high.So you need to have a designated nodal officer, a nodal ward, where every suspected case is tracked and tested. Till such time as test results come out, the patient has to be isolated and quarantined.At present, the government has created a nodal centre at the RML Hospital, where any patient who has Ebola-like symptoms can be tested. The hospital has set up wards to quarantine such patients.We also have the  National Centre for Disease Control and National Institute of Virology. So we are equipped.It is just that half-baked knowledge creates panic. If people are educated well and they are taught about preventive care, it can be contained.
