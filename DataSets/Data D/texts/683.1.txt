In Sierra Leone, with the most Ebola cases in the epidemic, a fearful population is failing to seek medical attention for any diseases, health officials say. If they have malaria, the feeling is they don�t want to go near a hospital with Ebola cases. If it�s Ebola, they don�t believe the hospitals can help them anyway, instead turning to traditional healers.It�s a widening challenge complicated by the fact that Ebola, malaria and cholera share common symptoms early on, including fever and vomiting, which can cause confusion among patients, said Cyprien Fabre, head of the West Africa office of the European Commission�s humanitarian aid department.
