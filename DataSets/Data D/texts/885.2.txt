The first alert was raised on 24 January, when the head of the Meliandou health post informed district health officials of five cases of severe diarrhoea with a rapidly fatal outcome. That alert prompted an investigation the next day in Meliandou by a small team of local health officials. The reported symptoms, including diarrhoea, vomiting, and severe dehydration, appeared similar to those of cholera, one of the areaï¿½s many endemic infectious diseases.
