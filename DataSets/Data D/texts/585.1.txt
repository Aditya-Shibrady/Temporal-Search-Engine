From October 2007 through March 2009, we enrolled 18 patients in whom MG/OG was detected. They were identified from a database of 247 patients who were clinically diagnosed with scrub typhus at either Wonkwang University Hospital or its branch (Kunsan Medical Center) located in southwestern Korea. In patients with MGs/OGs, we serially monitored the persistence of MGs/OGs and the titer of antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi from eight weeks to four months and reviewed their initial clinical features and laboratory results. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wonkwang University Hospital and informed consent was obtained from all patients.
