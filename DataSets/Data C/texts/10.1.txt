Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, American aid workers who were infected with the deadly Ebola virus in Africa, have recovered and have been discharged from an Atlanta hospital, officials announced Thursday. They were the first human beings to receive an experimental drug called ZMapp. But they are not the first people to have recovered from Ebola.
