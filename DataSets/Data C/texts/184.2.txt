Nowadays, RT-PCR1�and�94�and antigen detection ELISA1�and�94�are the primary assays to diagnose an acute infection. Viral antigen and nucleic acid can be detected in blood from day 3 up to 7�16 days after onset of symptoms.41�For antibody detection the most generally used assays are direct IgG and IgM ELISAs and IgM capture ELISA.1�and�94�IgM antibodies can appear as early as 2 days post onset of symptoms and disappear between 30 and 168 days after infection. IgG-specific antibodies develop between day 6 and 18 after onset and persist for many years.
