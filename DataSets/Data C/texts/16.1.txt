Two Americans who recovered from Ebola virus infections are contributing to doctors� understanding of the deadly disease, a physician who treated them says. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia while working for Christian aid groups. They were evacuated from Liberia, treated for three weeks at a hospital in Atlanta and discharged this week. "They no longer have Ebola virus in their blood and therefore pose no risk to household contacts or the public," the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement on Thursday. "There are no restrictions to the patients� activities of daily living."
