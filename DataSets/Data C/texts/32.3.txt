Perhaps the greatest mysteries regarding the filoviruses are the identity of their natural reservoir(s) and the mode of transmission to wild apes and humans [7,34]. While Marburg virus has been isolated directly from bats captured in Uganda [57], only Ebola virus sequences, not infectious virus, have been detected in samples collected from bats in Central Africa [58,59]. However, data suggest that bats are at least one of the reservoir hosts of Ebola viruses in Africa [60]. The transmission pathway from bats to humans, and the possible role of bats in the initiation of the 2014-2015 West African outbreak have not been defined.
