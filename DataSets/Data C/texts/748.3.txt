Prevalence: The body louse lives in clothing and multiplies very rapidly under poor hygienic conditions. Lice proliferate rapidly in refugee camps and other crowded, unsanitary conditions and the risk can be expected to increase in rainy seasons, when more clothing and blankets are used.      Since World War II, large outbreaks of typhus have occurred mainly in Africa, with reported cases coming predominantly from three countries: Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda. In Ethiopia, the number of annual cases reported annually has ranged between 7,000 and 17,000 (except in 1979, when a higher number was reported), although most have not been confirmed in a laboratory. In the 1970s, major epidemics which occurred in Burundi and Rwanda were documented by serology and isolation: in 1975 alone, 9,000 cases were reported in Burundi. In 1996, Burundi reported 3,500 cases and that number jumped to 20,000 for the period from January to March 1997. Louse-borne typhus should be suspected when people in crowded, louse-infected conditions experience sudden onset of high fever, chills, headaches, general pain and severe exhaustion alternating with agitation, followed on the fifth or sixth day by a macular eruption. Clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by serology.
