The FDA, as well as other companies, are currently working to speed up studies into possible Ebola drug treatments, but Ribner was not able to comment on any specific drug candidate, adding only that �we�ve looked at a variety of agents that may be available.� Still, even without proving the success of ZMapp, information learned from Brantly and Writebol�s cases has done much to help advance science�s understanding of the Ebola virus. At the moment, a number of doctors are working on writing medical journals on Brantly and Writebol�s care with the hopes of distributing the information to colleagues in Africa.
