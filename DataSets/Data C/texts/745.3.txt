Public health officials choose how and when to quarantine people based on a combination of factors, not just transmissibility alone. If they are not quarantined, contacts might travel into another province or state. Such travel makes it difficult to manage their condition or to perform further contact tracing. Also, they might introduce the disease into a new area. (This happened in Mali, Nigeria, Spain and the United States.) So, if someone has had a "high risk exposure" to a person with Ebola, that person will be asked to take certain measures even if they feel well. They will be asked to stay at home, limit movements, and monitor their health for 21 days. Public health officials will contact them daily to ask if they have any symptoms.Mail and/or international shipping has not been implicated in the transmission of Ebola. Ebola spreads via direct contact with contaminated body fluids from a sick person.
