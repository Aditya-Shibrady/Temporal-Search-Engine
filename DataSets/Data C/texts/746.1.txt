Whether filoviral disease is initially considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms will vary markedly with the circumstances. In the setting of the current Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa, there is a heightened level of suspicion for Ebola virus disease both in local residents and in healthcare workers returning from the region to their home countries.However, the acute onset of a febrile illness in a person who lives in, or has recently been in West or Central Africa can result from a variety of infectious diseases in that region, including malaria and other causes of hemorrhagic fever, such as Lassa and yellow fever virus. In the absence of a history of possible Ebola virus exposure, these other causes may be more likely. The approach to evaluating patients with possible Ebola virus disease depends upon whether or not the individual displays signs and symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease, how likely the exposure is to result in disease (ie, level of risk), and when the exposure occurred (ie, within the last 21 days).?Patients who present with signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease (fever and/or severe headache, weakness, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage) should be immediately assessed to determine their risk of exposure to Ebola virus
