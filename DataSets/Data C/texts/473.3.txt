If you develop symptoms of malaria while still taking antimalarial tablets (either while you are travelling or in the days and weeks after you return), remember to tell the doctor which type you have been taking. The same type of antimalarial should not be used to treat you as well. If you develop symptoms after returning home, visit your GP or a hospital doctor and tell them which countries you have travelled to in the last 12 months, including any brief stopovers.
