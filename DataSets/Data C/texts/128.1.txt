Ebola virus disease symptoms and signs may appear from about two to 21 days after exposure (average is eight to 10 days). It is unclear why some patients can survive and others die from this disease, but patients who die usually have a poor immune response to the virus.Some other symptons are: bleeding both inside and outside the body (for example, mucosal surfaces, eyes) and difficulty breathing and swallowing.
