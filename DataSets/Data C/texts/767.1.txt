Viral hepatitis (heh-puh-TIE-tis) is a viral infection of the liver * that leads to inflammation of the organ. Infections caused by the hepatitis B and C viruses are contracted sexually or through contact with contaminated blood or other body fluids, but hepatitis A virus is more contagious and is the hepatitis virus that more commonly infects travelers. It can spread through person-to-person contact or through contaminated water and food, especially shellfish and raw vegetables and fruits. A person with hepatitis may have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, chills, and weakness. People with hepatitis A may need extra fluids and rest, but most recover without medication.
