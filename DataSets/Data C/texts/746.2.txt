2014 outbreak in West Africa ï¿½ Several measures have been implemented to help contain the current epidemic. These include:The World Health Organization has declared the Ebola outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [108,109]. This mandates countries to develop national preparedness capacities, including the duty to report internationally significant events, conduct surveillance and contact tracing, as well as exercise public health powers, while balancing human rights and international trade [110,111]. As an example, the decision to quarantine certain areas in West Africa has brought hardship to more than a million people but may be essential for containment [112].The United Nations (UN) has created a special mission to help contain the outbreak [113]. This is the first time that the UN has created a mission for a public health emergency.In the United States, public health authorities actively monitor travelers arriving in the United States if their travel originates in Liberia, Sierra Leone, or Guinea.The spread of Ebola virus has apparently been successfully limited in several areas where there have been adequate resources and an effective public health response (eg, Nigeria, Senegal, Firestone District of Liberia) . However, for other areas where there is widespread transmission, continued efforts should focus on case finding, identification and surveillance of contacts, and safe burial practices
