By mid-August 2014, 2,127 suspected cases including 1,145 deaths had been reported, however the World Health Organization has said that these numbers may be vastly underestimated. By mid-August, Doctors Without Borders reported the situation in Liberia's capital Monrovia as "catastrophic" and "deteriorating daily". They report that fears of Ebola among staff members and patients hasshut down much of the cityï¿½s health system which has resulted in leaving many people without treatment for other conditions. Additionally the outbreak has resulted in more than 120 healthcare worker deaths partly due to the lack of equipment and long hours. On 16 August 2014, a quarantine center in West Point, Monrovia was attacked by protesters who distrust the governmentand health care workers and believe that the epidemic is a hoax. The attack caused a number of patients being monitored forEbola to flee, while blood-soaked bedding and other infected items were removed. The incident was seen by medical officialsas a disaster as it had the potential to accelerate the spread of the disease. Tens of thousands of people in Liberia, Guinea,and Sierra Leone have been under quarantine, leaving them without access to food. The United Nations' World Food Programme hasannounced that it will deliver rations to 24,000 Liberian people affected by the epidemic. By late August, 2014, the diseasehad spread to Nigeria, where 13 confirmed cases and 6 deaths had taken place. The number of deaths at the time was 1,552 from3,069 cases reported. While the 2014 outbreak had occurred in March 2014, 40% of the cases had been reported in the previous3 weeks, WHO revealed, adding the acceleration could see the number of cases reported exceed 20,000.
