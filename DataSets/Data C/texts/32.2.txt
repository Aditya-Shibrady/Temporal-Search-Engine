Patients with Ebola virus disease typically have an abrupt onset of symptoms 6 to 12 days after exposure (range 2 to 21 days) [6,11,12]. There is no evidence that asymptomatic persons still in the incubation period are infectious to others. All symptomatic individuals should be assumed to have virus in the blood and other body fluids, and appropriate safety precautions should be taken [13]. (See�"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Transmission'�and�"Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease", section on 'Infection control precautions'.)
