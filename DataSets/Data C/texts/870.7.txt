The Ebola virus attacks connective tissue multiplying rapidly in collagen. Collagen is thetissue that helps to keep the organs in place. The tissue is basically digested by this virusThe virus causes small blood clots to form in the bloodstream of the patient;the blood thickens and the blood flow slows down. Blood clots get stuck into blood vessels forming red spots on the patient skin. These grow in size as the disease progress. Also, blood clots does not allow a proper blood supply to many organs such as the liver, brain,lungs, kidneys, intestines, breast tissue, testicles, etc.Spontaneous bleeding then occurs from body orifices and gaps in the skin, such as needle puncture marks and rips that can suddenly appear.Death is caused by huge loss of blood, renal failure, or shock.
