On Thursday, Dr. Kent Brantly thought he was going to die. It was the ninth day since the American missionary worker came down sick with Ebola in Liberia.His condition worsening by the minute, Brantly called his wife to say goodbye. Thankfully, the call was premature. Brantly is back on his feet -- literally -- after receiving a last-ditch, highly experimental drug. Another American missionary Nancy Writebol with Ebola got the same. They are the first to recover successfully after  being tested positive for ebola virus.
