After spending a month treating Ebola victims in the severely stricken West African country of Liberia, emergency physician Colin Bucks, MD, returned to California with perhaps one misgiving: It was having to say goodbye to his patients. “So much of the time was spent just helping out the nurses and providing emotional support and the connection to the patient. Being there was as much a part of the healing and recovery and demonstration of care as any medical decision we made,” said Bucks, a clinical assistant professor of surgery at the School of Medicine.
