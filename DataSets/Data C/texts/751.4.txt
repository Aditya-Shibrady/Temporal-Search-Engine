Prompt removal of attached ticks and use of repellents to prevent tick attachment provide the best preventions against tick typhus. Laundering of louse-infested clothing is the most effective means to avoid person-to-person spread of lice and prevent epidemic typhus. Precautions taken when walking in rural areas and the use of insect repellents will help prevent tick and mite-borne typhus.Vaccination against typhus is not required by any country as a condition for entry. Treatment of all forms of typhus is similar. Chloramphenicol, doxycycline or other forms of tetracycline result in rapid resolution of fever and relapses are infrequent.
