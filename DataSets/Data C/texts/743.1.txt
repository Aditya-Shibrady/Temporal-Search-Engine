An outbreak of Ebola has been ongoing in Sierra Leone since May 2014. Outbreaks are also occurring in Guinea, Mali, and Liberia; these outbreaks of Ebola are the largest and most complex in history. Civil unrest and violence against aid workers have been reported in West Africa as a result of the outbreak. The public health infrastructure in Sierra Leone is being severely strained as the outbreak grows.CDC recommends that US residents avoid nonessential travel to Sierra Leone. If you must travel, such as for humanitarian aid work in response to the outbreak, protect yourself by following CDCï¿½s advice for avoiding contact with the blood and body fluids of people who are sick with Ebola.
