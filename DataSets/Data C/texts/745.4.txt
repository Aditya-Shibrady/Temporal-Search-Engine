The most important thing is to remain calm. If you have not travelled to West Africa, it is extremely unlikely you have the disease. Even if you have been in an Ebola-affected country recently, it is highly unlikely you were infected if you avoided high risk activities. Consider: did I have sexual or other contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person? Visit a healthcare facility while in Africa? Touch any dead bodies or attend a funeral? Care for an Ebola patient? If these answers are �no�, it�s not very likely you have Ebola.If you have been in an area affected by Ebola, or you are currently in an affected country, monitor your health for three weeks (21 days). Seek medical attention if you develop symptoms. If you are still in Africa, call International SOS to find a facility - do not go to a local hospital or clinic without guidance. When seeking care outside of Africa, the first step is to call the facility so the staff can do a risk assessment and decide whether you should be around others / come in person to the facility. Mention your travel history and that you were in an area where both malaria and Ebola are circulating. Do not travel anywhere until you speak to a medical professional.Remember that many other diseases, including malaria, have symptoms in common with early Ebola infections. Malaria is present in the countries currently impacted by the Ebola outbreak and is a far more common illness. (It is still serious, though.) Your doctor should consider malaria as a possible cause of  your illness. Other common diseases with similar initial symptoms include dengue fever and typhoid fever.
