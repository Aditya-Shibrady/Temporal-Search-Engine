Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they do not need the flagella propellers to move themselves any more. Responding to the changed chemical surroundings, they stop producing the protein flagellin and again conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they manufacture. On reaching the intestinal wall, the bacteria start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea, which carries the multiplying and thriving new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next hostï¿½if proper sanitation measures are not in place.
