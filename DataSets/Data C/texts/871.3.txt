In the first few days after infection with Ebola virus, symptoms resemble those of other diseases: fever,headache, and muscle aches. The disease rapidly progresses to more serious symptoms such asrash, chest pain, severe bloody vomiting and diarrhea, uncontrolled internal bleeding, kidney and liverfailure, and shock .Doctors can diagnose Ebola fever based on symptoms seen in patients as they quickly become ill during outbreaks. Blood tests can sometimes identify the virus directly, or antibodies to Ebola produced by the body during infection can be detected in the blood. Doctors have to be careful when performing tests because simply injecting a needle into a patient who is prone to hemorrhage cantrigger uncontrolled bleeding.
