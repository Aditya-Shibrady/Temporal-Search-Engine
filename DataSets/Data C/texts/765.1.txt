Symptoms develop between 2 and 21 days after someone is exposed to infected bodily fluids. Initial symptoms are sudden fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. Vomiting, diarrhoea, rash and abdominal pain follow in most cases. Some people progress to organ failure and bleeding, both internally and externally, which leads to death.There is no cure for Ebola. Supportive treatment (such as intravenous fluids and managing secondary infections) increase a person's chance of survival, especially if medical care is given early in the illness.There is no vaccine to protect people from infection. Ebola outbreaks are controlled by keeping people from infecting one another: people with the disease should stay away from others, ideally in a dedicated Ebola treatment centre. Their contacts should be monitored for illness. Business travellers are at low risk of infection. While in an affected area, pay strict attention to hygiene. Avoid sick people, their bodily fluids and any facilities that are treating suspected Ebola cases. Do not have contact with or eat bats, gorillas, monkeys and other non-human primates. Avoid communal handwashing during funerals or other public gatherings. (When possible, avoid funerals entirely.)GuineaA significant outbreak of Ebola was first reported in Gueckedou, Guinea in March 2014 although it is likely cases had been infected earlier in late 2013. The outbreak is ongoing. See the dedicated Ebola website for latest information.
