The only Ebola patient to have died in the USA was Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who was initially sent home from a Dallas emergency room. He returned to the hospital a few days later when he was vomiting. He was not eligible for a blood transfusion because his blood type didn't match that of any Ebola survivors, and he received an experimental therapy only a couple of days before he died.
