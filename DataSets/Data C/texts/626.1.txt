As of 2014, the most widespread epidemic of Ebolavirus disease (EVD) in history is currently ongoing in three West African countries.It has caused significant mortality, with a reported case fatality rate (CFR) of about 71%.It began in Guinea in December 2013 and then spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.A small outbreak of twenty cases occurred in Nigeria and one case occurred in Senegal; both countries were declared disease-free on 20 October 2014.Secondary infections of medical workers have occurred in the United States and Spain but have not spread further. An independent outbreak of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that started in August 2014 has been shown by genetic analysis to be unconnected to the main epidemic.
