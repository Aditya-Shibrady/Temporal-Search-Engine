The 2014 West African Ebola virus outbreak, now more correctly referred to as an epidemic, is the largest ever to occur. As of August 28, 2014, concerns have been raised that control efforts, particularly in Liberia, have been ineffective, as reported case counts continue to increase. Limiteddata are available on the epidemiology of the outbreak. However, reported cumulative incidence data as well as death counts are available for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. We utilized asimple, two parameter mathematical model of epidemic growth and control, to characterize epidemicgrowth patterns in West Africa, to evaluate the degree to which the epidemic is being controlled,and to assess the potential implications of growth patterns for epidemic size. Models demonstratedgood fits to data. Overall basic reproductive number (R0) for the epidemic was estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.0, consistent with prior outbreaks. However, we identified only weak evidence for the occurrence ofepidemic control in West Africa as a whole, and essentially no evidence for control in Liberia (though slowing of growth was seen in Guinea and Sierra Leone). It is projected that small reductions in transmission wouldprevent tens of thousands of future infections. These findings suggest that there is an extraordinary needfor improved control measures for the 2014 Ebola epidemic, especially in Liberia, if catastrophe is to be averted.
