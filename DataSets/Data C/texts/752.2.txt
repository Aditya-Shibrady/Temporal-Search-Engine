High rates of chronic infections are also found in the Amazon and the southern parts of eastern and central Europe. In the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, an estimated 2ï¿½5% of the general population is chronically infected. Less than 1% of the population in western Europe and North America is chronically infected.TransmissionIn highly endemic areas, HBV is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth, or from person to person in early childhood.Perinatal or early childhood transmission may also account for more than one third of chronic infections in areas of low endemicity, although in those settings, sexual transmission and the use of contaminated needles, especially among injecting drug users, are the major routes of infection.
