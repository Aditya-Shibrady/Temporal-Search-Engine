A similar rapid test,�ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit (Corgenix, USA), was just approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week.�This test is only for Ebola. The other problem is that the�accuracy of that test is not great: the sensitivity was 91.8% and the specificity was 84.6%, lower than that for the benchmark PCR tests.�This means that 8% of patients with Ebola would be missed by this rapid test, and 15% of people tested, although not ill with Ebola, would test falsely positive for the virus. Neither outcome has good consequences. Because of these inaccuracies, the screening should still be followed by the time-consuming confirmatory testing.
