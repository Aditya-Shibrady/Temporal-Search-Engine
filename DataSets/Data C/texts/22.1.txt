The EBOVdtec-RT-qPCR Test comprises a series of species-specific targeted reagents designed for detection of Zaire ebolavirus by using qPCR. Zaire ebolavirus is one of the 5 species of genus Ebolavirus, a member of Filoviridae family. Ebolavirus can infect different animals and are responsible of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), a severe disease of humans and primates. Ebola can spread in the community through human-to-human transmission, with infection resulting from direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such fluids. The incubation period is 2 to 21 days and illness is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. EHF has a fatality rate of up to 90% and no vaccine neither specific treatment is available.
