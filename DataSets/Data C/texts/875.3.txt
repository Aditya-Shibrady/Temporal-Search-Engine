Ebola generally starts with flu-like symptoms. Though it's known for the extreme hemorrhagic symptoms -- the bleeding out of the eyes, etc. -- not everyone will experience these. "In fact, only 20 percent of people will have [these extreme symptoms]"."Some people may succumb to the illness before it gets to that point, some may have minor bleeding, some may just have bleedingof the gums, or bruising."
