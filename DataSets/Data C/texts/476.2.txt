And that's what makes the 2014 outbreak so remarkable: a year since the first patient was identified last January, the virus has spread to nine countries, including the US (plus a separate outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and has already infected more than 20,000 people. It has killed more than 10,000. That is more than four times the sum total of all previous outbreaks combined, making this epidemic one of the worst public health crises of the last century.
