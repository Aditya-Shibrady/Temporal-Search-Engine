A number of Ebola Treatment Centres have been set up in the area, supported by international aid organisations andstaffed by a combination of local and international staff. Each treatment centre is divided into a number of distinct and rigorously separate areas. For patients, there is a triage area, and low- and high-risk care wards. For staff,there are areas for preparation and decontamination. An important part of each centre is an arrangement for safe burialor cremation of bodies, required to prevent further infection.
