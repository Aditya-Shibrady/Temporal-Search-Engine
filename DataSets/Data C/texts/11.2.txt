Those are some of the details revealed for the first time in a case study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The paper outlines the treatment Brantly and fellow health care worker Nancy Writebol received after they became the first Americans infected with the deadly virus while aiding Ebola patients in Liberia. Brantly had a 102 degree fever when he was finally evacuated to Emory University Medical Center in Atlanta for treatment 10 days after his symptoms developed. Both he and Writebol recovered after several weeks of hospital care, including repeated doses of an experimental drug. By studying how their cases progressed and what treatment they received, researchers hope to learn more about the most effective ways to treat Ebola.
