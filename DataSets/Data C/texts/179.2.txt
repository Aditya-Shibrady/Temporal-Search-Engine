Typhus is transmitted when infected insects prey on humans and animals. The disease can be found in the fecal mater of the insects. When the human scratches at the insect bites, the bacteria makes its way into their system. Controlling populations of these infestations with insecticides can rapidly decrease the chances of the spread of typhus. Efforts to control the rodent population are helpful as well.
