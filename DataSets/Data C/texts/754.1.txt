Hepatitis B is the world's most common liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which attacks and injures the liver. It is transmitted through blood, unprotected sex, shared or re-used needles, and from an infected mother to her newborn baby during delivery. Most infected adults are able to get rid of the hepatitis B virus without any problems. However, most infected babies and children are unable to get rid of the virus and develop chronic infections. Hepatitis B is most common in Asia, Southeast Asia, India, parts of Africa and South America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. However, even in the United States, 1 out of 20 Americans have been infected with hepatitis B and an estimated 1.25 million have chronic hepatitis B infections.
