Murine typhus, also known as "endemic typhus," "Mexican typhus," and "flea-borne typhus," is a flea-borne infection of humans worldwide. Symptoms are similar to those of epidemic typhus fever (transmitted by the humanbody louse), but typically much less severe. If untreated, patients with murine typhus can require hospitalization,but the case fatality rate is only about 2% in the U.S. However, travelers to Asia and African should note that the case fatality rate is thought to approach 70% in certain areas in which murine typhus occurs.
