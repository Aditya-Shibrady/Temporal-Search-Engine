The paper highlights the symptoms experienced by Brantly and Writebol during their illness, which are consistent with all three "textbook" stages of Ebola: fever and flu-like symptoms, followed by gastrointestinal illness and hemorrhaging. By the seventh day of his infection, Brantly vomited blood. Writebol developed peripheral neuropathy -- numbness and tingling -- in her feet, which required a neurological medication used to treat nerve pain, which Lyon said can occur in certain viral illnesses.
